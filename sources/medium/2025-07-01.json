It was my own doing; regrettably, I have no accomplices to share the credit with. I genuinely empathize with fellow Kaspers who felt confused, distressed, or deflated by my actions. Though I cannot offer a sincere apology, I can and should offer more\u00a0context.</p><p>The reader should be warned in advance that my argument will be constructed rather ouroboros-ly, in a manner which makes it illogical to refute. The more the reader disagrees with it the more they are forced to recognize the validity and relevance of the argument. I learnt this little trick of constructing self-enforcing arguments from one old Chaldean family from the 19th century BC, whose story is not entirely irrelevant to\u00a0ours.</p><p>Terah was a Mesopotamian idol manufacturer. The <em>Midrash of Genesis</em> (tales by Jewish sages) describes how one morning Terah left his son Abraham to watch the idol shop. Abraham seized the moment and took a stick and smashed all the idols, except the largest one. He then placed the stick in the hand of that remaining idol. When Terah returned and saw the destruction, he demanded, \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Abraham replied, \u201cThe idols got into a quarrel, and the big one decided to smash the rest.\u201d Terah exclaimed, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a fool? These idols have no knowledge or power!\u201d And Abraham replied, \u201cThen let your ears hear what your mouth is\u00a0saying.\u201d</p><p>Some odd 48 hours ago someone left the largest idol alone with access to Kaspa\u2019s official X account. I consulted no one before changing the account from \u201cKaspa\u201d to \u201cKaspa (Unofficial)\u201d, nor did I prepare any crisis management plan. Though, perhaps like Terah\u2019s son, I have waited for the right moment for a long\u00a0time.</p><h3>The Bourne\u00a0Identity</h3><p>To the extent that this saga turns into an identity crisis for many Kaspa fans, it is a long-overdue one.</p><p>There is a choice to be made: Are we here for the cozy feeling of a cohesive community with a welcoming center of the hub, or are we committed to penetrating the crypto\u200a\u2014\u200athence the broader\u200a\u2014\u200amarket with a p2p electronic cash system and a trustworthy store of\u00a0value?</p><p>In the past 18 months, the marketcap of bitcoin surpassed that of silver, twice. What would it take for us to be able to think of KAS in similar\u00a0terms?</p><p>The technology of Kaspa is superior to Bitcoin\u2019s many times over, largely due to elite architecture and execution by Crescendo devs. But why is Kaspa Crescendo celebrated? Because it achieves a 6000x improvement over Satoshi\u2019s protocol whilst remaining in the confines of the same trust model\u200a\u2014\u200aa center-less structure which delegates the control over the network to an anonymous set of miners. A set which, to be explicit, comprises egoistic entities that should never be trusted, and yet whose competing incentives align with that of securing the\u00a0network.</p><p>There are dozens of crypto projects which offer much richer tech stacks, production live apps, and marketing budgets than kaspa or bitcoin. Kaspa\u2019s value can be unlocked and recognized only only only if Kaspa is-looks-feels-smells culturally open-source, practically center-less, constitutionally principled.</p><p>The existence of an official social account simply fails the gut\u00a0check.</p><h3>A public mask of the\u00a0project</h3><p>The main social account, practically an official one, with announcements and press releases, is convenient and facilitative indeed, and could be argued to have been instrumental early on. It is nonetheless a headquarters of the brand, and those who populate the headquarters are inadvertently co-opting the identity of the network. The consolidation of influence becomes inevitable, whether or not the people controlling the socials would consciously choose such an\u00a0outcome.</p><p>Despite the dogmatic sound of the argument, it is no less a pragmatic one; I became conscious of it through observation more than through first-principles thinking. Specifically, I observed that for a team building a product or layer atop Kaspa, the best approach at community engagement and capture is through the conviction, if not friendship, of the maintainers of the social accounts. Alignment with them is an asset, misalignment\u200a\u2014\u200aa liability. Needless to spell out the consequences: Even if the main accounts are governed with virtue and kept far from corrupt, a hierarchy forms\u200a\u2014\u200aone which is easily spotted by newcomers. Visitors and newcomers are the first to recognize the whos and whats of the in-group, and through their experiences I became increasingly aware how our community is increasingly losing its flat hierarchy, its mission, and its chances at fulfilling it.</p><p>To be maximally unambiguous about this\u200a\u2014\u200athe individuals who maintained so far the socials would never opt to gain power or deliberate influence. When interacting with them, I was inspired by their firm belief and selfless devotion to Kaspa\u2019s mission; they truly love Kaspa, resembling perhaps the love and devotion of the mother-GHOST, from CS Lewis\u2019 The Great Divorce, to the spirit of her son\u00a0Michael.</p><p>In particular, they have never undermined the authority of Kaspa Core; had they attempted to do so, that would be a breath of fresh air. The issue we are highlighting here, therefore, has to do with representation more than with alignment. Many Kaspa X\u2019ers hold paradigms, mental models, or style that I\u200a\u2014\u200aand other members of Core\u200a\u2014\u200aobject to. This is perfectly normal and nothing needs to be done about it. We are not, however, seen as represented by any of these accounts. In contrast, with the official X account, the interpretation is different: It is the most followed Kaspa account, it is named plainly \u201cKaspa\u201d, it offers press releases and formally-styled updates, and it actively nurtures the brand. We, Kaspa members, and especially Kaspa Core, are practically represented by it; it is a forced mask on the face of the project and of Core, and no matter how good the maintainers are at their jobs, it is still a\u00a0mask.</p><p>I trust the reader to not be confused by my admission that these individuals understand brand-building at a deeply higher level than I do, and that they have been undoubtedly instrumental to the growth of Kaspa community and brand. If someone asked me in the future regarding the expertise of these individuals, I would unquestionably recommend them and vouch for their brand-building-and-nurturing expertise, my lack of experience in marketing being the only reservation to a warm recommendation and a big\u00a0yes.</p><p>My argument notwithstanding.</p><h3><strong>Second things\u00a0first</strong></h3><p>Reflecting on the media of exchange of ancient man, and of modern primitive societies, one can argue there exists a reverse correlation between the degree of cohesiveness of a society\u200a\u2014\u200awhich can be achieved at scale only through rigid hierarchies\u200a\u2014\u200aand the moneyness qualities of its MoE. A strictly hierarchical society, the Andean Inca for instance, was able to thrive with barter and social obligations alone; their hierarchical structure replaced many functionalities that money serves in modern civilization, such as the allocation of resources and the flow of information. More heterogeneous civilizations had to adopt more scalable MoE\u200a\u2014\u200acowrie, to name one notable example\u200a\u2014\u200awith barter frequently still coexisting, as in the city-states of Yoruba. Further along the spectrum (chronology aside), the merchant-oriented Mesopotamian civilizations utilized silver for payment and accounting\u200a\u2014\u200aa yet more scalable and practical medium of exchange for urban, complex\u00a0trade.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/410/1*LX88o4dMtpgVLxwvtofjtQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>By Published by Guillaume Rouille(1518?-1589)\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cPromptuarii Iconum Insigniorum \u201c, Public Domain, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8804631\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8804631</a></figcaption></figure><p>Is it a good thing then to describe Kaspa community as united and conflict-free? This community is one of the friendliest and welcoming communities in crypto. Compared to Bitcoin 2014\u20135 it is virtually toxic-free. The atmosphere, at least that projected by the brand\u2019s headquarters, is almost too positive and worry-free.\u00b9</p><p>Yet, getting too attached to the friendly vibes, or over-priding ourselves on that, would be \u201cputting second things first\u201d, to borrow CS Lewis\u2019 phrase. We should prioritize debates, rebuts, arguments, disputes, concerns. There are serious challenges ahead of Kaspa\u200a\u2014\u200asecurity budget, decentralized governance, monolithic vs modular architecture, HF policies, open-source funding, degen vs elitism, L2 fragmentation\u200a\u2014\u200aand if we are not fighting over those issues we are probably doing something wrong. Probably, we are delusional about their seriousness, or worse yet delusional about Terah\u2019s ability to solve them all through the genius of his\u00a0idols.</p><p>First things first, for Kaspa to become a money, a globally trusted asset in the order of today\u2019s trillions of US dollars, the community\u2019s culture must be conducive to becoming the cradle of money. Some degree of tension and contention must linger in the air for the moneyness properties of a society\u2019s collectible to emerge. Our rivals, our competitors and adversaries, must feel comfortable storing their wealth herein. High net worth individuals who distrust this author\u200a\u2014\u200ahopefully the club has grown larger in the past 48 hours\u200a\u2014\u200amust feel Kaspa is nonetheless an absolute safe haven for their wealth. It must pass the eye test of institutional investors. Kaspa must Bitcoinize.</p><h3><strong>Ethereum, North Korea,\u00a0Vitalik</strong></h3><p>Ethereum is the most important crypto platform alongside Bitcoin.\u00b2 No-one in Ethereum epicenter was seriously considering a rollback after the ByBit hack, the psyops notwithstanding. Ethereum is orders-of-magnitude more mature and distributed than it was in the DAO hack days. Nonetheless, the ByBit hack can be used as a thought experiment to reflect on hierarchies and their implication to moneyness.</p><p>In spring 2016 I was invited by Andrew Miller to Cornell, where he and Elaine and Emin Gun organized an Ethereum bootcamp. Around that time, Emin voiced the DAO vulnerabilities (eg <a href=\"https://x.com/el33th4xor/status/736266834073276416\">https://x.com/el33th4xor/status/736266834073276416</a>), and a few days later the vulnerabilities were exploited by an anonymous \u201ccode-is-law\u201d hacker. It so happened that the bootcamp took place during the intervention\u200a\u2014\u200atechnically not a rollback but a manual HF to induce an irregular state transition. The Ethereum squad attended the bootcamp as well, and we all followed closely the community\u2019s anticipation/support/outrage, the Classic\u00a0split.</p><p>While Ethereum matured since\u200a\u2014\u200aone year later, Vitalik didn\u2019t initiate a reversal of the Parity hack and the wallet freeze\u200a\u2014\u200aone can argue that the effects of the DAO intervention are lasting: The primary effect of the intervention was not the violation of code-is-law rather the cementing of Vitalik\u2019s position as the ruling arbiter. The decision not to reverse Parity was still perceived as Vitalik\u2019s call rather than an inevitable consequence.</p><p>Whether a code-is-law view should be adopted should be a discussion for another day. Suffice it to say that a puritan stance lacks completeness in that it does not address systemic collapses\u200a\u2014\u200aa breaking of the hash function, to provide an extreme example\u200a\u2014\u200aor a huge 51% attack\u200a\u2014\u200awhere the social consensus will anyways violate the code\u2019s dictation this way or another (I will post later a seemingly conflicting post regarding a WWIII-resilient finality adjustment protocol).</p><p>Code-is-law being less relevant, the discussion or rather reflection should evolve around the structure of the social-political-economic graph which shapes the social consensus, at least post catastrophic failures. And in the case of Ethereum, the network exhibits a supernode, a brilliant, reasonable, and responsible one, a single point of pressure nonetheless.</p><p>This is not to insinuate Vitalik has omnipotent power in the community; this is far from the reality of the community. Vitalik cannot pull off arbitrary code-change or impose protocol modification at his whim, he cannot act capriciously, his decisions face scrutiny, similarly to other leaders in structured organizations which are more often than not constrained by protocols and customary processes. It is not even to claim Ethereum is centralized\u200a\u2014\u200a-this tired label is by now emptied from any tangible meaning by narrative grunts, and should be discarded. This is merely to say Ethereum is as robust as Vitalik is. It is far from being antifragile.</p><p>(Antifragility is a very useful adjective, coined by Taleb, and [GPT:] refers to a system or entity that not only withstands stress and shocks but actually benefits and grows stronger from them. Unlike robustness, which resists damage but does not improve, antifragile systems thrive in uncertainty and volatility.)</p><p>Again, this argument does not undermine Ethereum\u2019s supremacy nor Vitalik\u2019s leadership; the reader can acknowledge those and still comfortably remain an eth maxi. This is merely to point to the centrality of Ethereum\u2019s social graph, to its single point of pressure, which is admittedly risky only in black swan events, but crypto is quite a hotbed for black\u00a0swans:</p><p>Consider for instance a scenario where OFAC used the DAO precedent to force the hands of Vitalik and the EF to rollback the ByBit hack, lest they be deemed liable for being complicit in violating US sanctions. It is difficult to predict how would Vitalik and EF react in such a turn of events, and what would the community\u2019s expectation and social consensus be in this scenario.</p><h3>Conquest\u2019s second\u00a0law</h3><p>Can Ethereum rearrange its social graph? I recollect Conquest\u2019s second law of politics which states that an organization not constitutionally right-wing (or freedom maxi) will inevitably become left-wing (admin/intervention maxi), which should translate in crypto terms to: A project not constitutionally decentralized will inevitably centralize and ossify. In my head, I call this the reverse second law of cryptodynamics. (<a href=\"https://x.com/hashdag/status/1683507762204909568\">https://x.com/hashdag/status/1683507762204909568</a>).</p><p>Vitalik has historically evaded the question of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cmoneyness\u201d. In discussions I had with him in the past he rather dismissed this value proposition, and his public stance too was and still is non-committal. To me, this vague stance suggested not a lack of rigor but a recognition of the elusiveness of money\u200a\u2014\u200aone can argue money is more of an emergent property of a commodity or asset rather than a defined checklist that an asset must satisfy in order to deserve the money title. Ethereum\u2019s mindset is by and large consistent with &lt;Ethereum is tech; money is a rhetorical device; by adoption of the tech we achieve de facto a behaviour that is indistinguishable from\u00a0money&gt;:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*JioJMKGxkQi6QdcDRWYZxA.png\" /></figure><p>This tech-oriented stance is quite reasonable and pragmatic, albeit shortsighted. Historically, widespread adoption has indeed upgraded many commodities into moneys, irrespective of their soundness traits (whatever exact criteria this entails). In the long term, however, these moneys were replaced by collectibles which were optimized for moneyness properties to begin with. Cf. <a href=\"https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2016/07/artifacts-of-wealth-patterns-in_15.html\">Nick Szabo\u2019s essay</a> on the origin of money (not coincidentally, Nick was one of the biggest supporters of the code-is-law stance towards the DAO\u00a0hack.)</p><p>To complete the context, the current argument in Bitcoin circles regarding an OP_CAT plugin pertains, on a deeper level, to the question whether Bitcoin\u2019s path from collectible to money is secured by the mere demand for it as store of value/e-gold; or rather an additional demand as a utility, e.g. a defi rails, is needed to support its moneyness, and without such demand it will remain \u201ca\u00a0Rolex\u201d.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*sKfeVdfyhFTV13-wBwXrcA.png\" /></figure><h3><strong>Crescendo mainnet\u00a0launch</strong></h3><p>Kaspa humbly suggests that a defi rails should satisfy the property of intra-round (simply: real-time) censorship resistant sequencing with subsecond confirmation (/inclusion) times, rather than inclusion times in the order of 10 minutes and censorship-resistance latency in the order of 1\u00a0hour.</p><p>There is a sense, therefore, that Crescendo feels like a second mainnet launch of Kaspa. For the reasons mentioned, a pure proof-of-work 10 BPS consensus constitutes a qualitative upgrade to Kaspa\u2019s consensus engine, it ranks high in the ordered list of the value propositions of our money (refer further to Michael\u2019s braindump, <a href=\"https://x.com/MichaelSuttonIL/status/1905387292853703157\">https://x.com/MichaelSuttonIL/status/1905387292853703157</a>). Whether the timing of the trouble in Terah\u2019s family has to do with this \u201cmainnet launch\u201d is left to the reader as an exercise.</p><p>Alongside Michael, (and the symbolically-pseudonymous @someone235), another magician, a truly pseudonymous contributor @coderofstuff_ took ownership, and I wish him or her to remain faceless throughout our adventurous journey to silverness.</p><h3><strong>Kaspa Terah</strong></h3><p>The mainstream libertarian vision of governments expects their intervention when the need to break monopolistic entities arises, particularly those whose existence hinges on uneven grounds and structured leverage. Drawing the relevance of this axiom to the context with which this blogpost started is, too, left to the reader\u2019s imagination.</p><p>Trust me, don\u2019t trust me. As promised, it is very difficult to save the ouroboros creature. If I have disappointed you, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t have appointed me in the first place. If you wished for the masks to remain, I have merely pointed at the faces overseeing the masquerade.</p><p>*<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SeStQ1g4Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SeStQ1g4Y</a></p><p>[1.] I\u2019m not hinting that this is not unrelated to the current maintainers being Canadian and Australian.<br />[2.] For\u00a0now.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5f100e0555a4\" width=\"1\" />",

These interests may be at odds, but we are very early in our growth path, still categorically a positive-sum game. <br />In particular, future arrival of ASICs will be an overall positive for Kaspers, GPU miners included, similarly to GPU miners\u2019 arrival being a big win for the CPU miners which they outmined.</p><p>Decentralization has more to do with the openness, permissionless, level-field nature of the market rather than the degree of heterogeneity in outcome. Fewer entities dominating mining is not inandof itself a sign of centralization, as long as they are unable to impose nonlinear rich-get-richer effects; for an example of the latter in longest-chain consensus, see Theorem 4 in <a href=\"https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2015/aamas/p919.pdf\">https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2015/aamas/p919.pdf</a></p><p>We are all romantically biased towards a visually egalitarian hashrate distribution pie-chart (a sentiment which leads many, in sociopolitical contexts, to wrongly expect fair systems <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/thomas-sowell-on-the-fallacy-of-equal-outcomes/\">to demonstrate equal outcomes</a>). And, admittedly, capital itself is a barrier-to-entry and brings about some non-linearity to the game. However, this is the price of victory, paid by each and every ecosystem when passing the tipping\u00a0point.</p><p>Moreover, Kaspa uniquely requires CapEx-heavy mining to fulfill its vision, as will be explained shortly. And so, when time comes and Kaspa shifts into \u201cheavy\u201d mining, we will welcome its maturity phase with great satisfaction, albeit a tinge of\u00a0sadness.</p><h3>On Kaspa and\u00a0CapEx</h3><p>(A previous post on this topic: <a href=\"https://hashdag.medium.com/in-which-i-have-no-patience-to-wait-til-by-and-by-b79ce53726b3\">https://hashdag.medium.com/in-which-i-have-no-patience-to-wait-til-by-and-by-b79ce53726b3</a>):</p><p>Kaspa perfects the consensus layer, primarily in terms of speed of confirmation; secondary\u200a\u2014\u200athroughput capacity, decentralization; down the pipeline\u200a\u2014\u200aMEV resistance.</p><p>Speed of confirmation is contingent on the mining market being illiquid, since in liquid mining environments, 51% attackers are theoretically\u200a\u2014\u200aand, in low marketcaps, practically\u200a\u2014\u200afeasible, and can be fended away by waiting time (or/and finality gadgets) and not by num of confirmations.</p><p>Typically, liquid vs illiquid is characterized by GPU vs ASIC, more inherently it is OpEx vs CapEx. The more CapEx will dominate mining costs, the less feasible it\u2019d be for an attacker to rent temporary hashrate, eg via NiceHash; currently, about 5.3% of Kaspa network is NiceHash-able, and so we are seemingly still in safe illiquid territory.</p><p>CapEx-heavy mining is also more efficient (aka \u201cenergy efficient\u201d), as a smaller fraction of the security budget is burnt with every new block. This efficiency is important both for the deflationary (no KAS minting) phase of Kaspa, but mainly for addressing the wastefulness of mining heads on, which is imperative if we are to aim at mass adoption. Notwithstanding the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1481654012772372498?t=kxCxqpNm6q_5uui48Y5Cdg&amp;s=19\">good arguments</a> defending the energy consumption dynamics of POW, in its current form, POW is politically infeasible, and adoption considerations should supersede fundamentalism. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/musalbas/status/1359972560738406401\">https://twitter.com/musalbas/status/1359972560738406401</a></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DdHvPwKpkXaj-2zfFt6Neg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>All in all, CapEx-heavy mining is essential for virtually instantaneous confirmation times in permissionless consensus, thus for Kaspa to fulfill Satoshi\u2019s p2p electronic cash\u00a0vision.</p><p>Note: Indeed PoS is pure CapEx, but the security considerations at the limit itself are non-continuous\u200a\u2014\u200aa system with epsilon OpEx behaves materially differently than one with 0 OpEx, as the latter requires internal, state-dependent Sybil protection whereas the former hinges on external sources to distribute voting\u00a0power.</p><h3>Optical POW</h3><p>Optical computation is a technology that utilizes interactions of photons, rather than electrons, to process computation. Optical POW (OPOW), envisioned by Michael Dubrovsky, is a POW-function optimized for optical machines. The low energy consumption would render OPOW extremely CapEx-heavy, and would thus be ideal for Kaspa, following above reasoning.</p><figure><img alt=\"An OPOW miner prototype; from the original OPOW paper\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/421/1*etQdhJOVXkNK91u2-vb2pQ.png\" /></figure><p>The current POW-function of Kaspa, kHeavyHash, is already friendly to optical ASICs (it is, of course, computable by CPUs, GPUs, and regular ASICs too!). This function can probably be further optimized, more R&amp;D is needed\u00a0here.</p><p>For the original OPOW paper see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05193\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05193</a>; for a recent Stanford lab paper on OPOW see <a href=\"https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology_detail.php?ID=44752\">https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology_detail.php?ID=44752</a></p><p>OPOW is a decentralizing force. It levels the mining field by centering competition around capital rather than energy, the former being order-of-magnitude easier to transport, convert, and distribute.</p><p>Aside from geographical decentralization, the low-carbon signature additionally allows for stealth mining operations, the existence of which is essential for censorship resistance (recall <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/21/can-ethereum-fight-back-against-the-uss-sweeping-censorship-attempt/\">Ethereum\u2019s OFAC-compliant</a> effective censorship of Tornado Cash transactions).</p><p>AFAIK optical ASICs will not enter the game in the short-to-mid term, pace depends on R&amp;D efforts and funding, which is fortunately above my paygrade (and I will obviously have no dog in this fight). Nevertheless, it is important to recollect and reaffirm the original vision we had when choosing Kaspa\u2019s kHeavyHash, and to ensure community alignment around\u00a0this.</p><p>Changes to the current version of kHeavyHash are probably necessary in order to optimize for OPOW, ideally parameter adjustments only, and with reasonable heads up to the mining community. Governance of such changes is TBD, and will depend on whether and how we can avoid centralization on the manufacturing end. This way or another, optical tech initiatives should be first citizens in Kaspa colony, as they are vital for a p2p electronic cash system to scale up while maintaining Satoshi principles, efficient security budget, geographical decentralization, political feasibility.</p><p>TLDR; Kaspa operates at the speed-of-light.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c68717a8d309\" width=\"1\" />",

    "summary": "<p>Sharing below quick thoughts on development funding models and sustainability, and on the next grant request, with the hopes that my incentive biases do not contaminate my thought process too\u00a0much:</p><ol><li>DAGKNIGHT (DK) was an academic effort by Sutton and myself, conceived on the New Year of Trees,\u00b9 and released to the open three years later, on the 14th anniversary of Satoshi\u2019s WP release. As its birth-givers, we obviously wish to observe its impact on real world systems, and it doesn\u2019t get more real than Kaspa. The protocol still requires some (presumably, our) attention before standing on its own feet, and we detailed the main TODOs in <a href=\"https://github.com/kaspanet/kips/blob/master/kip-0002.md\">KIP\u00a0#2</a>.</li><li>One operation mode would be to work on this for the sole sake of bringing our research into fruition, in \u201cweekend project\u201d mode, with no other incentive in play. This path is perhaps the default one in the gift culture of open-source, indeed one which DAGlabs RIP converged on when releasing Kaspa mainnet with neither a premine nor a heads-up on mining nor any founders\u2019 rewards or the\u00a0likes.</li><li>Another operation mode, popularized by <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/\">Gitcoin</a>, is to receive a grant from the community in exchange for code contribution, occasionally with some milestones or/and timeline commitment. This mode is the prevailing custom in Kaspa community, and accordingly we are publishing today a grant proposal. The grant request is for 70 MKAS, which is ~0.5% of the circulating supply. For comparison, the previous funded grant was 100 MKAS, which was ~1% of the circulating supply.<br />My thought process here is to consider a hypothetical senior software engineer, Alice, with relevant domain expertise. When planning her path forward, Alice will seek either stability or opportunity, and in particular will typically not consider a short-term day-job for the same paycheck she\u2019d receive for a long-term one. With this in mind, it makes little sense to denominate in USD deep-tech Kaspa grants (instability), rather they should be expressed in KAS terms (opportunity).<br />The same mental mode was behind the denomination of the previous grant in KAS, which was at the time greatly off the ballpark salary for the relevant devs. Hence the KAS denomination of this grant proposal too. The 0.5% ask seems reasonable to biased-me, especially when benchmarked against the previous\u00a0grant.</li><li>The community accepting the grant is by no means a necessary condition for having DK implemented on Kaspa\u200a\u2014\u200aSutton and I will attempt at implementing it regardless, since, again, there exists already a non-materialistic incentive for us to do so. However, since we are not saints, this will be done on our spare time with non-committal or unspecified timeline.</li><li>A third operation mode, which too exists in open-source environments, is to found a for-profit enterprise around an open-source layer, which naturally incentivizes the entity to allocate resources to further development of the kernel. E.g., IBM\u2019s symbiotic relationship with Linux. This path has the highest potential for long-term sustainability, though, of course, a for-profit entity would have its own priorities, and thus the timeline for DK execution would remain equally ambiguous.<br />I imagine this model could more realistically materialize around smart contracts, which are in arm\u2019s reach from financial innovation opportunities. In contrast, DK is strictly an infra development, and has little to do with the app\u00a0layer.</li></ol><p>[1] More on trees\u2019 new year <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_BiShvat\">here</a>.

    "summary": "<ol><li>Crypto winters are warm for projects with character.</li><li>Last month Michal Sutton and I published the <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1494\">DAGKNIGHT</a> protocol (DK), which to the best of our knowledge is the first POW consensus protocol that is responsive to the network\u2019s actual (*adversarial) latency while being resilient to 49% byzantine attackers. DK is the culmination of nearly three years of research, a period in which we weren\u2019t at all sure if the aforementioned property is at all possible to achieve.\u00b9</li><li>Some work still needs to be done before considering DK for Kaspa:<br /> <br />(i) Completing several missing details in the proof section.<br /> <br />(ii) Preparing the paper for peer-review (depends on conference target).<br /> <br />(iii) Devising efficient algorithms\u200a\u2014\u200athe current pseudocode is highly inefficient, as it was optimized for ease of reasoning rather than real world implementation.<br /> <br />(iv) Adapting the consensus algorithm to meet additional requirements of an actual cryptocurrency, e.g., the need to regulate minting, control difficulty, and enforce pruning, all of which require a responsive synchronous protocol (rather than DK\u2019s partially synchronous operation mode).</li><li>Similarly to GHOSTDAG, DK enables high bps (blocks per second), just with much faster confirmation times. Some research needs to be done in order to suggest the optimal bps\u200a\u2014\u200aincreasing the rate indefinitely doesn\u2019t necessarily shorten confirmation times, as it increases the higher relative latency or DAG width. The increase is both due to more blocks created per second and due to these blocks\u2019 headers being larger. Regarding the latter factor, one can envision a scenario where confirmation times improve by reducing the number of block references inside a block (either in consensus or as a default mining rule), but whether or not this is the case is pending further research.</li><li>DK enables additional features, on which more research is needed.<br /> <br />(i) One example that comes to mind is <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008017.html\">flexcaps</a>, a proposal to allow miners to create blocks of different sizes and difficulties. While proposed originally for Bitcoin, at high block rates flexcaps require the DK consensus. To see the connection, observe that larger blocks \u2192 higher propagation delay of blocks \u2192 more blocks created in parallel \u2192 wider DAG; and the DK protocol uniquely does not need to bound in advance the width of the DAG, and can cope with it varying even across short timespans. One motivation for flexcap is to support, in times of peak demand, a higher throughput than that which the system can support on average. Indeed, large blocks consume both instantaneous load on the system (CPU, network congestion, etc.) and an accumulating load (larger UTXO \u2192 higher RAM and disk I/O for later block processing), which justifies a gap between the maximum limit on resource consumption and the average one.\u00b2 This gap is enabled through flexcaps (or through the similar <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521\">elastic block cap proposal</a>).<br /> <br />(ii) Another potential feature is the <a href=\"https://github.com/kaspanet/research/issues/1\">stealth txns</a>, a construction which <em>utilizes</em> the asynchrony caused by high bps to protect users from MEV (relevant when smart contracts will be developed). More generally, and still in the context of MEV, the fact that many miners can create a block in the \u201cnext round\u201d, can be utilized to facilitate richer transaction fee mechanisms, in some resemblance to Flashbots\u2019 recent\u00a0<a href=\"https://writings.flashbots.net/the-future-of-mev-is-suave/\">SUAVE</a>.</li><li>Similarly to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kaspanet/kips/blob/master/kip-0001.md\">Rust upgrade</a>, this consensus upgrade will require a new grant request from the community. A suggested scope and raise amount will follow. I hope miners and other Kaspa whales will find this initiative as desirable and long-term profitable as the previous grant. Our community is evergrowing in size and interests, and raising large funds in the future might become harder and harder, at which point we will need to find other structures to maintain development. Hopefully we haven\u2019t reached yet the tipping\u00a0point.</li><li>Speaking of community size, a Discord moderator pressed a wrong button this week and accidentally kicked out all inactive users from the server, reducing Kaspa Discord community (~12k) by about 25%. The good news is that we learnt that ~9k members were apparently active in the last 30 days, which speaks volume of the quality of the community.</li><li>In the spirit of thanksgiving, I am grateful to all 9k of you for turning Kaspa from a sound protocol to a sound\u00a0money.</li></ol><p>[1] More accurately, one of us was positive throughout that a possibility is within a hand\u2019s reach, and the other was skeptic and believed an impossibility result was lurking in the dark. Interestingly, the roles reversed with respect to the question whether Kaspa can take off. We swore not to reveal the corresponding identities of the weak in faith, but the reader can be assured that between the two of us the truth always\u00a0lies.</p><p>[2] In Bitcoin, where there\u2019s no pruning of historical data, the gap is even larger, due to initial blockchain download that full nodes go through by default when onboarding.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c080bcef2f3a\" width=\"1\" />",

    "summary": "<p>This is a concrete version of a longer post which I started writing but had too much spare time so didn\u2019t complete\u00a0yet.</p><p>Context: One of Kaspa\u2019s core devs, Michael Sutton, suggested a plan to order-of-magnitude enhance Kaspad full-node performance by refactoring the codebase and rewriting it in Rustlang. (<a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/844142778232864809/993245032670842991\">https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/844142778232864809/993245032670842991</a>)</p><p>My twosats on the\u00a0matter:</p><ol><li>Kaspa was initialized as a live proof of an idea, a demonstration of a novel (and very cool, but that\u2019s beside the point) paradigm for permissionless consensus. In bootstrapping Kaspa, I was fully aware that we do not have the resources\u200a\u2014\u200aor the manpower\u200a\u2014\u200aor the organization machinery\u200a\u2014\u200arequired to unlock even 5% of Kaspa\u2019s potential, and that some external strategic move will need to happen for that aspiration to come true (think Project Serum and Solana <a href=\"https://defirate.com/ftx-serum-solana/\">https://defirate.com/ftx-serum-solana/</a>).</li><li>For these reasons, as Kaspa OG\u2019s recall, <a href=\"https://hashdag.medium.com/kaspa-launch-plan-9a63f4d754a6\">I considered launching</a> Kaspa in testnet mode, then opted for a novel (aka failed) mode, which I coined \u201cgamenet\u201d, and which can be thought of as \u201ctestnet with incentives\u201d. While this attempt was apparently na\u00efve and, in retrospect, flawed I am mentioning it to recollect the mindset with which Kaspa was released. (For the same aforementioned reasons I kept myself uninvolved with the exchange listing efforts of Kaspa; I fully appreciate their value to the community, and at the same time I preferred erring on the side of caution).</li><li>I agree with concerns voiced by some community members that, in principle, to bring real value efforts should be focused on integration, adoption, marketing, etc. In particular, at this stage, high bps and high tps are imho not a meaningful step towards building a non-hypothetical financial system.</li><li>However, our community is still far from the scale and organization necessary to reach actual adoption, if not merely for its still modest treasury size (which is contribution-based, and managed by a few volunteer OG\u2019s). With that in mind, I believe the most correct usage of the funds donated by miners is to continue the path of demonstrating live the original DAG vision, by improving the base layer node and later on perhaps upgrade its consensus; which is precisely the proposal put\u00a0forward.</li><li>The current Kaspad codebase is an adaptation of the Bitcoin client btcd, written in Golang. It enjoys a fine amount of technical debt and great code complexity, which make it difficult for new folks to contribute. The proposed refactoring explicitly aims at writing the codebase in a modular and legible manner, which is arguably even more important than performance enhancement.</li><li>For full disclosure, I am working tightly with Sutton for a few years now, and am highly biased in favour of any R&amp;D task or project to which he dedicates his rare talent (cf. Proverbs 27:14). Him availing a few months\u2019 of his full capacity to Kaspa is exceptional, and I hope the community (and esp. miners) will match this generosity. I believe a ballpark of 1% of the circulating supply would be very reasonable.</li></ol><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce6a1a2c8eb0\" width=\"1\" />",

    "summary": "<p>This post assumes reader context on the crash of the Kaspa network in the course of the last 48 hours, and provides some additional notes and perspective.</p><p>(1) To simplify logic and debugging, and since the gamenet concept didn\u2019t really catch air, I removed the random block reward and replaced the average block reward of 500 with a deterministic block reward of 500. Thus, if so far we mined <strong>on average</strong> 86400x500=43200000 Kaspa per day, we will henceforth mine <strong>deterministically </strong>86400x500=43200000 Kaspa per\u00a0day.</p><p>(2) Many ppl expressed their concern about the future rebase that will take place soon. I want to reiterate that the rebase is cosmetic only, it\u2019s a rename, an altering of representation. If you mined so far, say, 10% of the (total or of the circulating) supply of Kaspa, you will posses 10% after the rebase as\u00a0well.</p><p>(3) The deflationary monetary policy HF that I mentioned here (https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/909907923084382218/911015904144420895 or <a href=\"https://hashdag.medium.com/kaspa-launch-plan-responding-to-reality-6b4bec449037\">https://hashdag.medium.com/kaspa-launch-plan-responding-to-reality-6b4bec449037</a>) will be specified next week, after syncing and mining resume for a few days, the network remains fully operational and confident, and the voluntary Kaspa magicians (Ori, Michael, Elichai) get some sleep and catch up with their own research and ventures.</p><p>(4) The community by and large reacted solidly to the crash. Thank you! No-one took it lightheartedly, and at the same time most focus was on providing datadirs and other useful info, getting instructions, funny memes. Let\u2019s hope we won\u2019t need to test ourselves again in similar circumstance.</p><p>(5) There was some genuine misunderstanding regarding the approaches we were looking into. Specifically, we were never considering a rollback in the sense of pointing at an early state which we were satisfied with and wanted to revert to, and discarding blocks and transactions appended to it later. Rather, we were searching for the <em>latest</em> state for which we have a <em>certainly-valid</em> UTXO commitment. While many users shared with us up-to-date datadirs, and while we had our own datadirs, we had to spend effort and time to ensure that the UTXO commitment builds correctly. Thus, we (read: aforementioned devs) had to rebuild the state afresh, feed it with such datadirs, and compare the commitments. Fortunately, the UTXO that we built hashed into the same UTXO commitment string embedded in the latest block in the datadir, producing 710f27df423e63aa6cdb72b89ea5a06cffa399d66f167704455b5af59def8e20, which proved that the DAG UTXO algebra was not erroneous, but \u201cmerely\u201d a victim of the memory problem. This is not to say the architecture of this module should not be revised and improved\u200a\u2014\u200a-a more correct architecture would protect it from DB failures.</p><p>(6) Kaspa is here to stay, in case you were wondering.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8c7f4fa35834\" width=\"1\" />",

Seeing my PhD obsession\u200a\u2014\u200aPOW DAG consensus\u200a\u2014\u200arealize itself into a live network and a spontaneous community is thrilling yet humbling. Thank you,\u00a0<em>Todah</em>!</p><p>I\u2019m definitely going to start valuing members-count over citation-count, so please bring more crypto friends to the\u00a0party!</p><p>Every few years a new fair-launched POW cryptocurrency captures the excitement of the community\u200a\u2014\u200aLitecoin, Monero, Grin, and now Kaspa. May the force be with\u00a0us.</p><p>Since we didn\u2019t anticipate this rapid growth, I didn\u2019t prepare accessible answers to several FAQs. I hope to write a longer post about all this in the coming days, but for now here are some\u00a0answers:</p><ol><li>Monetary policy will be deflationary. Halving will be more aggressive than Bitcoin\u2019s since market conditions are different (order-of-magnitude faster market discovery). When the deflationary scheduling will be activated, and what would be the initial block reward (compared to the current avg of 500)\u200a\u2014\u200aTBD. We will try to seal this next week or so. These numbers will imply the finite cap on supply. BTW we should rebase the term Kaspa to refer to today\u2019s 1000 Kaspa, say; the current representation feels not so scarce\u00a0:)</li><li>Our proof-of-work is a Kaspa variant of heavy-hash, let\u2019s call it k-heavy-hash. My goal here was to create a CapEx heavy POW function, since I believe this concept is both energy-efficient and provides more miner-commitment (stronger than ASIC since less OpEx burnt). Whether k-heavy-hash is actually CapEx heavy, and whether a different POW function will better serve this goal for Kaspa\u200a\u2014\u200ais a question I\u2019m open to\u00a0discuss.</li><li>The project is maintained by a few devs, all of which have other full time dealings, and some of which are funded by DAGlabs (but totally self managed). In particular, there\u2019s no company or entity behind the project that is responsible for your wallet, full node, funds, miners. We are here during our spare time. I, for one, am a full time postdoc at Harvard university, and while this project is my PhD baby, I am at the same time dedicated to my postdoc baby. So this is a purely community project, please take that into consideration. What can you do to help? Arrange for more dev-power to learn the codebase and join the efforts; DAGlabs can potentially fund additional devs, as long as they have the ability to manage themselves, open issues, fix bugs, manage PRs,\u00a0etc.</li><li>Roadmap. There is no official roadmap as there\u2019s no organized development. I can write down what devs should be working on IMO, post bug fixing and version updates (HFs). In short, IMO priorities should be accelerating <em>gradually</em> to 10 blocks per second, then implementing an amazing upgrade to the consensus protocol, pending theoretical research results of Michael Sutton. In parallel, if someone can promote a privacy gadget (e.g., bulletproofs) and implementation for Kaspa that would definitely leap us\u00a0forward.</li><li>Next week there will be a hard fork (HF) in order to fix a bug and decrease header size. Tune in on this, especially if you are running a mining full node. A few weeks later there will be a HF to embed said monetary\u00a0policy.</li><li>Will we list the coin on exchanges? There is no \u201cwe\u201d, there\u2019s \u201cyou\u201d. And I suggest waiting for the community to grow more organically before bringing\u00a0retail.</li><li>When is it recommended to stress test for utxo throughput? You are free to stress test as you wish. However, note that even if bugs are discovered, some time will pass before the devs can make themselves available to fix them. Therefore, I suppose better wait for the current system to prove itself stable for more than two weeks,\u00a0say.</li><li>What about block explorer? I believe next week devs will deploy\u00a0one.</li><li>Feel free to follow me here or on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashdag\">https://twitter.com/hashdag</a> where I hope to post more Kaspa related material in the coming\u00a0weeks.</li></ol><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6b4bec449037\" width=\"1\" />",

The market has matured, and with it the scope of attacks and manipulations has expanded from direct attacks on block ordering (eg double spends via reorgs, liveness attacks) to attacks that regard txn content\u200a\u2014\u200atypically in the zero-to-one-confirmations phase\u200a\u2014\u200aby miners or bots (aka flashbots). Moreover, Kaspa lacks as of now EVM support, rendering it significantly less relevant to the current\u00a0market.</p><h3>Gamenet: A proposal to launch Kaspa in a novel experimental mode</h3><p>Kaspa may be launched as a research-oriented consensus engine that is focused on experimentation, novel testing of dynamics, and a vibrant battlefield for real world cryptoeconomics attacks. I call it gamenet\u00a0mode.</p><h4>Cryptoeconomics phase\u00a01</h4><p>[CPU/GPU mining, uncertain scarcity, low hashrate and security, non-commercializable]</p><p>The platform should be CPU/GPU-mineable, to facilitate the base activity; I believe Ethash is a neutral candidate that fits our needs. However, its token should be deliberately unfit for commercialization, in order to penetrate hardcore communities, individuals, and zones that refrain from cooperating with non-BTC or non-ETH tokens. Accordingly, the token\u2019s supply should challenge the ordinary notion of scarcity, and should be unfit for exchange listing. This implies that the platform will obtain low hashrate and low security, at the initial\u00a0stages.</p><h4>Gamenet activity</h4><p>[battle-field, simulation, real world game, selfish mining, reorgs,\u00a0MEV]</p><p>The theme of gamenet\u2019s activity can be thought of as a continuous hackathon over a live network which serves as a battle-test field for simulating real world attacks, manipulations, and dynamics of a multi-player network. The block rewards will incentivize occasional reorg/selfish-mining attacks by strategic and sophisticated miners of the gamenet, whereas transactions in the network will implicitly or directly reflect MEV exploits from real world DeFi systems such as Ethereum.</p><h4>Community</h4><p>[R&amp;D groups and individuals, testbed for innovation, recognition by broad crypto community]</p><p>The goal is to attract research and dev groups (e.g., flashbots fans) to play, compete and/or collude over the live system, and to extract insights on the real-world dynamics of other live systems such as Ethereum. Further, commercial L2 projects that propose solutions to certain exploits, such as using cryptographic primitives for MEV, can implement those over Kaspa gamenet and prove the robustness of their solution, while others may attempt to refute it. I hope Kaspa will become a center of a vibrant R&amp;D community, and that the general community will look to Kaspa gamenet as a credible source of insights regarding cryptoeconomic dynamics in the\u00a0wild.</p><p>An example for the community\u2019s interest around the topic may be found in this recent summit <a href=\"http://reorg.wtf/\">http://reorg.wtf/</a></p><h4>Cryptoeconomics phase\u00a02</h4><p>[monetary policy solidification, recover scarcity, compensate early community]</p><p>As the community and the platform matures, we will want to transition to a solid monetary policy, regulate the supply, and trade over exchanges. To this end, we may set an automatic trigger in consensus that will eliminate the randomness in the monetary policy, and the uncertainty of the supply, once a certain hashrate is reached. This will automatically compensate early participants\u200a\u2014\u200athe early miners of the network\u200a\u2014\u200aby rendering the mined tokens scarce in retrospect. See below for specifics. See <a href=\"https://fc21.ifca.ai/papers/222.pdf\">https://fc21.ifca.ai/papers/222.pdf</a> by Lucianna Kiffer for a related\u00a0design.</p><h3>Kaspa development and\u00a0support</h3><p>[community+product management, further development and\u00a0support]</p><p>As a continuous real-world hackathon, Kaspa gamenet can significantly enjoy some product and community management, conveying and demonstrating to the community the rules of the game and example dynamics. Community members are welcome to take the lead on these\u00a0fronts.</p><p>On the development side, and closer to the backend, explicit MEV activity can be simulated via a bridge from Ethereum. While not necessary for gamenet, I believe gamenet+MEV will make the platform much more attractive a battle-field.</p><p><em>Individuals capable and willing to take upon themselves some of these efforts, and who require funding, may DM\u00a0me.</em></p><h3>Timeline</h3><p>[Kaspad ready mid October, Kaspa launch end of October, full gamenet activity\u00a0TBD]</p><p>Kaspad\u200a\u2014\u200athe core consensus component of Kaspa\u200a\u2014\u200awill be production ready (though untested) by mid October. The remaining features are (1) implementation of the monetary policy described below, (2) plugging in the chosen PoW function.</p><p>The execution of components that enhance gamenet activity depends on community engagement.</p><h3>Monetary policy and block\u00a0rewards</h3><h4>Requirements</h4><p>The block reward should incorporate randomness so as\u00a0to:</p><ol><li>Test selfish mining and reorg\u00a0attacks,</li><li>Introduce uncertainty regarding the\u00a0supply,</li><li>Incentivize extending the main chain, 95% of the time\u00a0(say),</li><li>Incentivize forking the chain when the reward\u200a\u2014\u200aor the MEV opportunity\u200a\u2014\u200ais exceptionally high.</li></ol><h4>Concrete proposal</h4><p>Have each block mint a random amount of Kaspa, where the randomness is a function of the last $M$ blocks. The result of the randomness, the \u201csampling\u201d, should depend on the block\u2019s hash, to ensure that it cannot be gamed. The randomness should not be a function of the previous block only ($M=1$) because that will lend itself to frequent forking attacks. At the same time, it should be responsive to recent blocks, to ensure a sufficient degree of uncertainty with respect to the supply (so $M=10\u00b9\u00b2$ won\u2019t do, as well). I propose $M=~100$\u00a0blocks.</p><h4>Formal description</h4><p>Given a DAG $G$, GHOSTDAG outputs a chain $C(G) \\subseteq G$. For each block $B \u2208 G$, let $merging(B)$ be the earliest block in $C(G)$ that contains $B$ in its past. For each block $B \u2208 G$, $B.selectedParent$ is the tip of the chain $C(past(B))$. For each block $B \u2208 G$, $mergeSet(B,G)$ is defined as $past(B)\u2216 past(B.selectedParent)$ if $B$ is in $C(G)$, and the emptyset otherwise.</p><p>The reward of blocks in G, $rew(*)$, is defined\u00a0by:</p><ul><li>$rew(genesis) =\u00a0const_1$</li><li>$rew(B) = const_2*avg_{D \\in prvs M blocks of B}rew(D)*4^x + const_3*sum_{D\\in mergeSet(B)}(rew(D))$</li></ul><p>where $x$ is a random variable drawn from the normal distribution (mean 0, std 1), and which is uncontrollable by the miner (it is the result of the block hash). $const_1=1$, and $0&lt;const_2,const_3&lt;1$ should be in the order of $0.9$ and $0.1$ respectively; $M$ should be in the order of 100 as mentioned.</p><h4>Hashrate trigger</h4><p>Once the network reaches a meaningful hashrate, one that corresponds to operational expenses of $I=250k USD$ per week (say), the randomness should be eliminated, and then each block should mine a block reward of $rew(B) = const_3$ (const_3=1, say). This could be triggered automatically in consensus and requires no soft/hardfork.</p><h4>Finality parameter</h4><p>In phase 1, due to the expected low security, the finality parameter of the system should probably be set to be in the order of minutes rather than hours. In case of netsplits, the conflict should be resolved manually, which is a legitimate practice in a non-mainnet platform.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9a63f4d754a6\" width=\"1\" />",

    "summary": "<h3>Don\u2019t trust,\u00a0terrify!</h3><p>The \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify!\u201d slogan is beyond my comprehension. I board airplanes without verifying anything about the pilot or the aircraft; I visit restaurants and foolishly eat\u200a\u2014\u200awithout verifying what will be transmitted to my blood; I take medicines without verifying the supply chain. Why would I protect my money with measures I am not taking to protect my\u00a0life?!</p><p>This reminds me of Jacob, the forefather of Israel, who crossed the Jordan river some 35 hundred years ago, back to his homeland. Albeit, he forgot a few small pitches (think of dust UTXOs), so we are told by later Talmudic Rabbis, and so he went back to the eastbank, in the middle of the night, alone, to fetch the pitches. This was apparently unsafe, and he met a mysterious figure who wrestled with him, a battle from which he came out with a limp, a divine blessing, and a new name\u200a\u2014\u200aIsrael. The Talmud concludes:</p><p>\u201c <em>From here it is derived that the possessions of the righteous are dearer to them than their bodies. And why do they care so much about their possessions? It is because they do not stretch out their hands to partake of stolen property.</em> \u201c</p><p>I hope the connection between this story and SPV sync mode based on multiplicative-hash UTXO-commitments is self explanatory but, just in case, do note that verifying by yourself the proper functioning of all external systems which you rely on is infeasible, unscalable, and anticivil\u200a\u2014\u200acivilization is the scaling up of function and trust\u200a\u2014\u200awhereas doing so only with respect to money is peculiar and will cause you to\u00a0limp.</p><h3>Why not\u00a0fiat?</h3><p>Because fiat supply is inflated unpredictably; because the political printing of money is corrupting the democratic sphere, positing the political debate on allocation of money instead of creation of wealth; because regulators are attempting to control financial transfers, eliminate cash, restrict economic\u00a0freedom.</p><p>We reiterate cryptocurrencies\u2019 golden traits\u200a\u2014\u200apredictable issuance and censorship resistance. In contrast, the property \u201cno fraudulent transaction ever occurred in this currency system\u201d is not the something (or at least: main thing) users should/care about. Consequently, when joining a cryptocurrency system, checking its issuance and its decentralization is far more important than checking the historical validity of transactions.</p><p>Yes, we go so far as to say that users do/should not care about historical corruption. For the user is interested in knowing that the state of her node is the one that is most likely to prevail by the economic majority, not that the state of her node is the valid one in some abstract sense. <em>The primary goal of consensus systems is facilitating</em> agreement, <em>not enforcing</em> consistency. And if the economic majority happens to follow and maintain a ledger to which an invalid transaction entered at some point in history, so be it, the system can still serve its purpose of facilitating agreement even if its constitution was breached at some point in time. Indeed, if code rules, the constitution, are violated time and again, or even not extremely rarely, the wise user should definitely refrain from joining said network. Users are therefore protected from unsafe networks as long as they can safely assume the existence of efficient ways to communicate and diffuse information on such mishaps. This novel way to diffuse information is called The Internet, or its manual predecessor\u200a\u2014\u200aCivilization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gVeVc_JLtgKMJjQUnviwlA.png\" /></figure><p>As with airplanes and restaurants, users rightly assume that they arrived at a functioning system, and that information on past security breaches would have reached them in the conventional information channels. These information channels are typically reliable thanks to highly-staked, ideological, or philanthropic whistleblowers that continuously verify the ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aor by previous users that have been harmed by the system\u2019s malfunctioning\u200a\u2014\u200agranting the system its herd immunity. Running full nodes are thus very important for the ledger\u2019s society, however, the marginal utility is rapidly decreasing.</p><p>To summarize: If you are going to join IOTA network, google it\u00a0first.</p><h3>Why not\u00a0Bitcoin?</h3><p>Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) is the process by which new nodes join the network. Since Bitcoin core devs\u2019 ethos is \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify!\u201d, the default behaviour of the new node is to download and verify the entire history of the Bitcoin ledger. Consequently, Bitcoin\u2019s throughput is deliberately limited to enable fast IBD-indeed, processing too many transactions per second today would make it difficult for a user joining in 2040 to verify that today\u2019s transactions were valid. I kid you\u00a0not.</p><p>Back in 2013 my advisor sent me a paper titled \u201cBitcoin: a p2p electronic cash system\u201d. The new narrative seems to have changed into \u201cBitcoin: an electronic store of value\u201d coupled with \u201cthe attempt to create a p2p electronic cash coin is a scam\u201d. An interesting development that\u00a0is.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/623/1*mdRaVUEqfc6uxohppCEKZQ.jpeg\" /></figure><h3>Why Kaspa?</h3><p>First, to make Satoshi great again. PHANTOM is really a neat generalization of Nakamoto Consensus (when k=0 PHANTOM coincides with the longest chain rule), it follows the same principles just with support for concurrency. It is Satoshi at its best, and the only path to fulfil His electronic cash vision. We make DAGs because we know how to and because no-one else does. We implement PHANTOM because we want to ping with \u201csend txn\u201d and be ponged \u201ctxn mined\u201d in the same manner we get the results of a google search or send an email. We picked up this challenge in the same way Bitcoin core devs chose to work on Taproot\u200a\u2014\u200ait is cool and not entirely\u00a0useless.</p><p>Secondly, to make myself\u00a0rich.</p><p>Third, because we need a base layer whose tradeoffs are centered around the crypto-informed user\u2019s needs and asks. This implies, in particular, and according to the worldview I suggested above\u200a\u2014\u200aimplementing the default node to skip historical verification, making it an optional operation, one that relies on the fewer archival nodes that some entities choose to maintain and make available (this is the same situation as in Bitcoin, since most Bitcoin full nodes are pruning the data necessary for syncing newcomers, but be advised to not share this info with Bitcoiners, it\u2019s gonna ruin their day and by implication your week). Importantly, these archival nodes maintain the ability to prove to newcomers that a certain transaction was fraudulent, by providing the Merkle witnesses for inclusion in the blocks involved in the claimed collusion.</p><p>Accordingly, Kaspa nodes prune block data by default, and new nodes by default do not request historical data, rather, they sync in SPV mode, i.e., by downloading and verifying only block headers. I reiterate that this is not a stronger trust assumption than a history-verifying node, rather a different requirement. The node then requests the UTXO set from untrusted peers in the network, and verifies it against the UTXO commitment embedded inside the latest received header (technically, this is done against the latest pruning point). If those do not match, the node bans the sending peers, requests the UTXO set from new untrusted peers, and repeats the process. If those match, the node verifies that no unexpected inflation occurred by comparing the sum of UTXOs to the specified minting schedule, a comparison for which block headers\u00a0suffice.</p><h3>Make Satoshi Great\u00a0Again</h3><p>My not-novel suggestion to scale up Nakamoto Consensus:</p><ul><li>Latency constraint on Consensus\u200a\u2014\u200amove from longest-chain to PHANTOM, which is tolerant to and compatible with any predetermined upper bound on the\u00a0latency.</li><li>CPU consumption\u200a\u2014\u200aprocess few transactions per second on L1, while supporting large payloads, which are cheap CPU-wise, and which enable easy and healthy L2 (e.g., SN/TARK proofs for\u00a0ZKRUs).</li><li>Bandwidth consumption\u200a\u2014\u200adesign sharding of data and data availability proofs, similar to Eth 2.0 stopped after phase 1 (see Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698\">rollup-centric revisited roadmap</a>); this is an open research question, since PoW has no native identities to serve as the basis for sharding.</li><li>Memory consumption and disk I/O\u200a\u2014\u200aimplement <a href=\"https://github.com/cambrian/accumulator\">class group based accumulators</a> that require no trusted setup, and which allow to prune the UTXO set and run as a stateless client. Challenges include: UX of storing and updating the witnesses; weighing memory save against higher CPU consumption.</li><li>Storage\u200a\u2014\u200aprune block data, reducing storage requirement from <em>O(block header size)*O(num of blocks in history) + O(block size)*O(size of history)</em> to <em>O(block header size)*O(num of blocks in history) + O(block size)* O(size of pruning window)</em>; additionally, consider pruning block headers, further reducing the requirement to <em>O(block size)*O(size of pruning window)</em>. Pruning block headers is an open research question, since it is then unclear how a new node will be guaranteed it is syncing to the consensus state and not to a stale or malicious branch. However, arguably, any system with (deterministic) finality enjoys/suffers/relies on weak subjectivity, and therefore reading the entire history of PoW might be redundant.</li><li>IBD time\u200a\u2014\u200aimplement DAG-adapted version of <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152680\">FlyClient</a> to reduce the cost of syncing a new node from O(num of blocks in history) to O(log(num of blocks in history)). This does not reduce the storage at the syncer, but does allow the syncee to sync w/o downloading the entire history of block\u00a0headers.</li></ul><h3>What are you syncing\u00a0about?</h3><p>Concluding today\u2019s topic. Kaspa is PoW on steroids. It is optimized for the informed users, not for the ideologs. Its throughput ought be constrained by real time performance considerations, not by the performance of downloading and verifying the historical ledger, which is an auxiliary trust gateway, but not the primary pillar of trust in the\u00a0system.</p><p>Kaspa should reach 100 blocks per second, and to that end, Kaspa nodes should be pruning data by default. When new nodes join the network, they should sync against the heaviest PoW DAG, as it is the one with max likelihood to represent the current consensus view. Node operators should take measures to connect to sufficiently many peers so as not to be eclipsed from the network (as in Bitcoin), so that they hear about historical mishaps, e.g., invalid blocks, finality violations, etc., which are recorded and propagated by full nodes to ensure that new nodes know what they are syncing\u00a0about.</p><p>I\u2019m reminded of the very best ad in the history of ads.

    "summary": "<h3>A personal\u00a0take</h3><p>Fun fact: Many Bitcoiners believe that Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block time is not too slow and that having a fast block rate is not\u00a0useful.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/596/0*IlBLIc35wJApcYSq.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/598/0*0ORtD7OGWk8ULTUF.png\" /></figure><p>This is a very disturbing stance, since I\u2019ve invested lots of conceptual and practical efforts into accelerating block times based on the premise that fast confirmation times-or \u201cLiveness\u201d in consensus terminology-matters, and it will break my spirit if this proves in vain. It is with the noble objective of making sure I\u2019m needed that I present to you below the case for fast Liveness. I believe it\u00a0matters.</p><h3>The case against fast confirmation times</h3><p>The elephant in the room: No one needs Bitcoin to be user-friendly; it is here to be HODLed, not used. Bitcoiners rarely pay with their bitcoins, a true Bitcoiner never sells them, and we can all just hope to be as sacred as He <a href=\"https://bitslog.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/\">who never even touched his bitcoins</a>.\u00b9</p><p>While obnoxious, this position is not ridiculous. The most difficult part solved by Bitcoin was the creation of a stateless algorithmically-controlled money system. Of course, this money should be transferable and, ideally, conveniently so; but the main achievement is not \u201cgood UX money.\u201d And if improving Bitcoin\u2019s UX would compromise its resilience, decentralization, or social scalability, it\u2019s not worth\u00a0it.</p><p>This position does imply, though, that <a href=\"https://github.com/kaspanet\">a different cryptocurrency</a> will prevail as a cryptocurrency that\u2019s intended to be used by the\u00a0masses.</p><h3>The case against fast block\u00a0times</h3><p>If you ever wondered why you are not invited to VIP Bitcoin parties, it\u2019s probably because you let it slip that you think fast blocks are cool, which proves your deep lack of understanding of our cult\u2019s core principles. This is where continuing reading this post can become very helpful for\u00a0you.</p><p>In order to understand what system parameters improve confirmation times, and when, we need to describe the flow of a crypto payment authorization.</p><p>If you are a merchant receiving payments in crypto, you must wait until transactions are sufficiently irreversible before confirming them to the payers. There are two paradigms on how this <em>waiting</em> is done. In the first paradigm, you wait for a sufficient amount of blocks to pile atop the transaction in the ledger; here, accelerating block liveness will shorten your waiting, namly, the confirmation time. In the second paradigm, you wait for a sufficient amount of (absolute) time to pass before confirming; accelerating block times will not shorten your\u00a0waiting.</p><p>Essentially, in the first paradigm you wait until enough <em>blocks</em> are mined so that the [hypothetical or invisible] attacker\u2019s chain is shorter than the ledger\u2019s main branch, with sufficiently high degree of certainty; in the second paradigm you wait until enough <em>time</em> passes so that the attacker\u2019s budget has drained. The two paradigms correspond to two threat\u00a0models.</p><h3>Illiquid vs. liquid\u00a0mining</h3><p>Bitcoin miners spend only a few 10 5USD/hour on protecting our transactions. Their revenue from mining-a.k.a. the <em>security budget</em>-is on the order of a few 10 6USD/hour. Contrast this with Bitcoin\u2019s market cap of a few 10 11USD, and you\u2019ve got yourself wondering how 10 6can protect a 10 11asset-surely there are ways to make much more than a few millions by attacking the Bitcoin giant, by reversing the ledger after an hour or two. For instance, if you are a financial whale that has the ability to short Bitcoin,\u00b2 or if your name is Vitalik and you want to double spend bitcoins to keep Bitcoiners from being obsessed with something other than Ethereum\u2019s success. Definitely worth a few billions.</p><p>Well, since the Bitcoin mining market is highly illiquid, an attacker cannot get hold of temporary hashrate even if he has a few spare 10 6USD. Instead, the attacker will need to invest in manufacturing or purchasing mining ASICs, which are priced for long term mining, and are indeed on the order of magnitude of 10 11USD. It is the capital expenditure of Bitcoin miners (CapEx), therefore, that protects our Bitcoin transactions, not their operational expenditure (OpEx). The high CapEx is what lends credence to our assumption that the majority of hashrate is held by honest miners (on which I\u2019ll elaborate below), whereas the OpEx seems too low relative to the potential gain from an\u00a0attack.</p><p>But many cryptocurrencies operate in liquid mining\u00b3 environments wherein significant hashpower is available for temporary rent on <a href=\"https://www.nicehash.com/\">NiceHash</a>; NiceHash is a marketplace for renting hashpower, typically relating to GPU-dominated coins. Now, if attackers can temporarily rent large amounts of hashrate, there\u2019s no reason to assume that they do not control a majority of it, during the attack window. Indeed, most of the 51% attacks on small cryptocurrencies have occurred in GPU-dominated mining environments. In these environments, one needs to think about the security of the system in different terms: Instead of the honest majority assumption, the security assumption underlying liquid mining environments is that a 51%-attacker\u2019s budget is limited and therefore he is unable to spend OpEx-by mining with GPUs or with rented hashpower-for long attack\u00a0windows.</p><p>The following table compares illiquid and liquid mining environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8FvApr7C_6akuW51wW5ZvA.png\" /></figure><h3>Payment authorization flows</h3><p>In the liquid setup, since the attacker\u2019s budget is affected by the <em>duration</em> of the attack, payments can be confirmed safely after enough <em>time</em> has passed. In the illiquid setup, since the block race between the honest majority and the attacking minority is governed by block creation events, payments can be confirmed safely after enough <em>block creation events</em> occurred. We conclude that block liveness matters in illiquid ASIC-dominated environments. QED.</p><p>Here is a payment authorization flow comparison between Bitcoin and\u00a0Grin:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/643/0*q0hVhhlU-uClaNA3.png\" /></figure><p>The above compares the payment authorization flows in illiquid, or Bitcoin-like, vs. liquid, or Grin-like, mining environments.\u2075 Observe that the attack cost-hence the waiting time for confirmation-does not depend on the block rate, in the liquid setup. In contrast, in an illiquid environment, <em>func(num_of_confs, attacker_rhashrate)</em> does depend on block creation events; so accelerating block times does in fact shorten confirmation times.</p><h3>On the altruistic majority assumption</h3><p>It is useful to recall Satoshi\u2019s original security analysis wherein neither honest miners nor the attacker regard their own incentives: The honest 51% follow the honest mining strategy altruistically, and the malicious 49% are irrational (aka <em>byzantine</em>) and attempt to maximize the damage inflicted or the success probability of the attack (and not the profit!\u2076). This is not to say incentives are not underlying the core logic of the system, rather that questions about why a miner would mine honestly or maliciously are discussed outside the security model; they are macro level questions, whereas a client accepting transactions should concern herself with micro level dynamics. It is these macro level arguments that may justify our honest majority assumption. Beware! My thought process here makes \u201cthe dumbest assumption of all,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1097020377778122752\">according to Nick Szabo</a> -namely, that Bitcoin\u2019s security strengthens as more CapEx is invested into it. I admit I don\u2019t get\u00a0it.</p><p>I\u2019m emphasizing Satoshi\u2019s <em>altruistic majority</em> assumption because some people argue that OpEx is essential to security and that without it an attacker could use the same mining resource to mine both good and bad blocks simultaneously (similar to the <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/\">nothing-at-stake</a> criticism of PoS). My counterargument is that the costless simulation phenomenon is noncontinuous and holds only in the absolute zero OpEx case. But either way, this micro level reasoning with respect to mining requires a different-and, in fact, weaker-security model, namely, one which treats malicious (and honest?) miners as rational profit-maximizing agents participating in a game. Understanding these mining dynamics requires thorough analysis of optimal mining strategies, and an attempt at that was started <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09193\">here</a>; also see <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978341\">this paper</a>. These results show that a rational attacker can in fact maintain long-term profitable attacks, which questions the assumption that attacks are costly and which intrigues rephrasing or rethinking the security\u00a0model.</p><p>In other words, I disagree with\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobMcElrath/status/1115945915137908736\">Bob</a>.</p><h3>ASICs are energy-efficient PoW</h3><p>I\u2019m not a fan of liquid mining systems. Yes, they are more democratic; anyone can plug in their GPUs, opt in, plug out, opt out. No barrier-to-entry, no barrier-to-exit. But this is a double-edged sword; \u201cOpEx-heavy\u201d means <em>you burn the security budget by using it</em>. It means the security-by implication, the ability to accelerate confirmation times-can only scale linearly with the amount of resources burnt on the system. To be very very very secure, we need lots and lots and lots of computational resources burnt for us. It works, but it\u2019s inefficient.</p><p>In contrast, \u201cCapEx-heavy\u201d means you are protected by the miners\u2019 investment, which locks them into the system and which is not burnt with every new mined block (outside of a negligible hardware\u00a0wear).</p><p>It\u2019s like the difference between buying a house and renting it. Your monthly mortgage payment might be similar to the rent, but you never enjoy a month\u2019s rental payment beyond living in the residence for that specific\u00a0month.</p><p>An ironic implication: Green PoW attempts which use available commodity hardware, such as <a href=\"https://www.chia.net/assets/proof_of_space.pdf\">Chia\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/post-asic/\">Spacemesh\u2019s proof-of-space</a>, are in fact more wasteful than ASIC-able PoW, because they constantly burn the security\u00a0budget.</p><p>Pro tip: When dating a Bitcoiner, never tell her you care about energy-efficient PoW. An immediate irreparable turn\u00a0off.</p><h3>Optimizing for the happy\u00a0path</h3><p>I would like to finish the blog by making a fool of myself and claiming that the most important threat model is when a no-attacker assumption is applied, formally, <em>attacker_budget</em> = $0 and <em>attacker_rhashrate</em> =\u00a00%.</p><p>In many use cases the payee is not really concerned by the payer carrying out a double spend attack. E.g., in cup-of-coffee-type purchases, or when the merchant knows and trusts the payer-remittance, in-person payments, etc. In such instances, good UX implies a very fast <em>first</em> confirmation time, that is, a short time span between the user broadcasting the payment and the receiver observing it has been mined into the\u00a0ledger.</p><p>This category includes also cases where the good or service paid for will only be delivered to the buyer at a later date. Such is the case in e-commerce which takes several days to ship, thus providing enough time for the seller before real harm can be done. And such is the case when trading crypto against a centralized exchange, or a crypto-to-fiat gateway, which settles the IOU at a later date, off-chain.</p><p>This <em>time-to-first-confirmation</em> metric is almost always overlooked, as researchers and devs tend to analyze the usability of respective blockchains in a principled methodology, and treat the first confirmation as merely one step towards sufficient (probabilistic) irreversibility of the state. However, while the system is only usable due to its robust worst-case guarantees, real-world usage frequently requires, simply, speedy inclusion in the ledger, which establishes the importance of the <em>time-to-first-confirmation</em> metric.</p><p>Importantly, note that in <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf\">PHANTOM</a> and many other DAG-based protocols, valid transactions that entered the DAG and that do not admit double spends will be accepted and admitted to the state regardless of the final ordering; in database language, they are <em>commutative</em> with respect to other transactions co-mined in the same level in the DAG. This implies that an attacker can reverse a payment only if he engaged directly with the victim, i.e., paid the merchant in exchange for another commodity or service and then went on to reverse the transaction. This is in contrast to a single-chain-based protocol where overriding the selected chain automatically overrides all transactions in it.\u2077 When we refer to an attacker with <em>attacker_rhashrate</em> = 0 we do <em>not</em> assume, therefore, that 100% of the mining is done by honest nodes, rather that no attacker node engaged with the merchant directly in the to-be-confirmed transaction (or in very recent transactions on which this one depends).</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a fast first confirmation is crucial for a good UX for the <em>payer</em>, regardless of the merchant\u2019s waiting and authorization policy. Paying with crypto is an anxiety-inducing process, and an ordinary end-user wants to see the result of her attempts as fast as possible. Bitcoin\u2019s ten minutes is just way too slow, it\u2019s not the way money\u00a0goes.</p><h3>That\u2019s the way the money\u00a0goes</h3><p>Impatience is a core trait of the Kaspa community. The main reason we are obsessed with DAGs is we want to see our transactions confirmed at Internet speed, similar to other web-based services. For use cases that require more than one confirmation we know to revisit the app later to check for the final status. Nevertheless, we need this speedy responsiveness out of the crypto app; we want a cryptocurrency to ping and be ponged, and we want it\u00a0now.</p><p>Impatience will also motivate the smart contract layer design I will propose here [WIP], where I will suggest optimizing for speed rather than for decentralization. Stay tuned, and start getting used to instant confirmations.</p><p>*<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOg6JkGa2ic\">Title reference</a></p><p>[1] Or maybe he just kept losing his private keys out of sheer cumbrousness, and he\u2019s now very upset about this whole Bitcoin\u00a0thing.</p><p>[2] One could challenge this claim if one could provide evidence that there aren\u2019t enough financial instruments and liquidity to profit, in the mentioned order of magnitude, from an hours-long attack on Bitcoin; then one would need to provide a model for confirming transactions based on the existing financial liquidity for such manipulations. Until then, we\u2019re\u00a0good.</p><p>[3] This term has nothing to do with liquidity mining in\u00a0DeFi.</p><p>[4] CapEx dominates in the initial days of the ASIC. Of course, as time develops the miner pays more and more OpEx. A mining-informed friend told me that a very rough approximation of the CapEx to OpEx ratio, at the end of the machine\u2019s lifetime, is 1:1. A PoW system which goes more extreme on the CapEx side would use an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05193.pdf\">optical PoW</a> function, which uses cutting-edge optical computing chips. These chips run the central part of the computation on photons, whose interaction does not emit heat, in contrast to electrons running on wire. Also relevant is a paper by Ganesh et. al., suggesting virtual ASICs, a protocol that mimics any point on the CapEx-OpEx spectrum.</p><p>[5] (*) <em>elapsed_time</em> is the time that passed between the transaction being included in the block and now. (**) A more nuanced approach to the <em>attack_cost</em> paradigm would consider additionally the <em>attack_success_probability</em>, for the case of an attacker renting less than 50% of the hashrate. This does not change the qualitative differences between the paradigms, and so to keep things simple I assumed instead that the attacker is &gt;50%, during the attack window, when attacking a liquid mining system. And vice versa: <em>elapsed_time</em> can be used in illiquid mining systems as well, to shorten confirmation times, if the client applies more sophisticated confirmation policies; see <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/040.pdf\">this paper</a>. Still, accelerating block times would accelerate confirmation times in these policies as\u00a0well.</p><p>[6] For instance, the bounds given by Satoshi on the attacker\u2019s probability of successfully overriding the longest chain are calculated for an attacker that never abandons his one-shot attack, even if many blocks behind. Such an attacker is clearly not concerned with cost and\u00a0profit.</p><p>[7] Admittedly, transactions removed due to chain reorgs can and in many systems are pushed back to the mempool. However, these transactions are not guaranteed to enter the blockchain in a relevant timeframe, either due to insufficient fees in the post-reorg congestion, or due to users keeping on transacting and innocently double spending previous payments.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href=\"https://blocklivenessmatters.com/blog/patience\"><em>https://blocklivenessmatters.com</em></a><em> on December 28,\u00a02020.</em></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b79ce53726b3\" width=\"1\" />",

DAGlabs is additionally funding many core Kaspa devs and researchers.\n\nFair launch\n\nKaspa contains no premine or founders\u2019 rewards.\n\nAt the same time, Kaspa is neither attempting nor pretending to be a \u201cfair launch\u201d coin, as the term \u201cfair\u201d is subjective, too broad, and absurd; early- and late-comers are at odds and cannot be co-satisfied. Bitcoin is extremely unfair to people born in 2030.\n\nThe last major attempt at a fair launch-the Grin MimbleWimble project-was not successful, disappointed too many early members, and effectively buried the project; the community and coin are influencing nothing in crypto today, which is sad and wasteful, as it is a beautiful protocol and was even built in Rustlang.\u00b9 Arguably, two properties of Grin contributed to its failure: it is GPU-based, hence has no barrier to entry and required no long term commitment from its early investors; and it has a constant block reward, leading to high inflation and hindering the store-of-value property for its early participants. Grin\u2019s attempt at mimicking Bitcoin\u2019s organic growth of value and community therefore failed, since the crypto market at that time (and certainly today) was already mature and developed, investment vehicles were well-employed, and participants\u2019 patience had significantly shortened due to other competing innovations.\n\nCommunity launch\n\nIn contrast, Kaspa is a \u201ccommunity launch\u201d coin.\n\nThe goal is that early members would (1) be able to secure themselves allocation of Kaspa, with some degree of certainty, and (2) enjoy a low inflation rate on their holdings. A mechanism to achieve this would need to (a) let the market price the opportunity (rather than, e.g., the core devs price it), (b) tune the inflation parameters in accordance with the \u201csize\u201d of the community as represented by some verifiable quantity. That is, the larger the community gathering around the coin, the lower inflation rate you want this community to suffer from, which translates to a steeper inflation curve.\u00b2\n\nSince the protocol itself is faceless and organization-less, the mechanism will be deployed outside the protocol, by DAGlabs, as the largest miner on day one, on a best effort basis, and entailing still a large degree of uncertainty.\n\nInitial Hashrate Offering\n\nDAGlabs will oversee a pre-launch customization of ASICs that will support a hash function specific to Kaspa, providing a head start on mining. These machines will dominate the market for an unknown period until other players decide to enter. The value of these machines must be distributed across early contributors, investors, the community, and a future development fund in some form of ASIC presale. The benefits of an \u201cASIC presale\u201d model are described thoroughly in Nic Carter\u2019s post, In support of the proof of work [un]fair launch. TL;DR: Kaspa will have good and well-understood PoW security from the start, the regulatory risk normally surrounding token presales is reduced, and early adopters are rewarded and development is monetized at a limited capacity, among other benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, and diverging from Carter\u2019s ideal, it is impractical for DAGlabs to support a logistical pipeline of physical distribution and shipment of machines, due to several factors: (i) it would be too expensive and cause logistic havoc, (ii) there is not enough demand for pre-sold ASICs-average miners wouldn\u2019t acquire machines that can only mine a coin that does not yet exist,\u00b3 and (iii) the ASICs are not particularly friendly to home users, so even folks with a few GPUs-who would normally be a good audience for an ASIC presale-would find it slightly more challenging to operate an ASIC.\n\nThus, DAGlabs\u2019 main efforts would be (*) distributing the mining machines both geographically and politically, and (**) facilitating economic participation of the community in mining, namely, creating a financial vehicle for early community members to be invested in the coins mined by the machines. Later efforts would include (***) further distributing the full nodes that control the mining process, enabling community members to run the software that dictates the block templates to be mined, and (****) creating a thin logistical pipeline to sell machines to interested parties and enthusiasts.\n\nNo free launch\n\nBefore mainnet launch, a DeFi contract will auction out the right to future Kaspa coins. Interested community members will lock some coins (say, ETH) on said DeFi contract and receive Kaspa at a future date. These Kaspa would originate from the machines operated by DAGlabs. The coins will flow to the contract, and in exchange the contract will release the locked ETH and send them to DAGlabs. The money will (1) repay DAGlabs for the capital expenses of the ASICs, (2) fund the operational expenses of these ASICs, and (3) be saved for future development.\n\nImportantly, in case DAGlabs does not flow Kaspa in a relevant timeframe (for whatever reason), the contract would automatically unlock the ETH and return them to the participants; thus, even in the worst case, a participant will not pay without receiving the promised Kaspa. To discourage DAGlabs from maliciously keeping Kaspa instead of flowing it to the DeFi contract, there will be an off-chain tool that continuously demonstrates the hashrate of the ASICs, providing transparency around mining.\n\nParties that participated in this contract-based ASIC pre-sale and are interested in owning and holding the ASICs physically should contact DAGlabs to arrange this; DAGlabs won\u2019t be able to cover the shipping cost.\n\nFinally, as argued above, participation in the pre-sale importantly determines the size of the early community and the timeline of community growth, which in turn should determine the aggressiveness of the minting curve, or the disinflation rate. The larger the size of the early community (i.e., higher participation in the DeFi contract), the more aggressive we can and need to be with disinflation in order to protect the investment and participation of the community. Thus, the end state of the DeFi presale will determine the disinflation parameters of Kaspa monetary policy embedded in the Genesis block of Kaspa, according to a precommitted formula.\n\nA concrete description of the contract and mechanics appears here.\n\nTitle reference\n\n[1] The excitement around Grin was comprised as follows: 15% \u2014 writing in Rust, 25% \u2014 author\u2019s pseudonym \u201cMimblewimble\u201d from Harry Potter, 25% \u2014 the protocol itself, allowing cut-through of STxOs when syncing new nodes, 35% \u2014 a known Blockstream dev contributing to the project.\n\n[2] To some extent, the to-be-described mechanism replaces one of the roles of PoW, namely, a slow and organic price-discovery and distribution mechanism. Indeed I argue that in today\u2019s crypto climate PoW can no longer fully serve this role properly, and is instead \u201cjust\u201d the best infrastructure for a secure, sovereign cryptocurrency.\n\n[3] Most miners, as it turns out, follow the market and do not lead it. They are not particularly interested in the software and the protocol, which explains why they won\u2019t be a proper target audience for an Initial ASIC Offering.\n\nOriginally published at https://blocklivenessmatters.com on December 14, 2020.",

I was recommended by the head of school to work with Aviv Zohar, but Aviv suggested we work on Bitcoin and, coming from mathematics undergrad studies, I found Bitcoin awfully boring and practical. A half a year later, during Shabbat dinner, a friend told me about Bitcoin, and since I hadn\u2019t done anything useful in the time that passed, I decided to return to Aviv (I spent the preceding semester trying to solve the Goldbach conjecture in order to win a $1M prize. In retrospect, I could have gotten the money by investing a few bucks into Bitcoin. Mistakes happen.\u00b9)\n\nMy project lab turned into a Financial Crypto paper analyzing the security-speed tradeoff of Nakamoto Consensus and proposing the GHOST protocol. GHOST is an alternative to Bitcoin\u2019s longest chain rule, using the proof of work embedded in off-chain blocks by traversing the tree structure (resulting from forks under high speed) and selecting the main chain differently. The idea was to count the number of blocks that extend a certain block rather than the length of the chain above it. This was supposed to alleviate the need to suppress the block time and to allow for very speedy blocks without suffering from orphans and deteriorating security. Some time after the protocol\u2019s publication, Vitalik Buterin incorporated GHOST into the Ethereum white paper and roadmap. Ethereum didn\u2019t end up implementing GHOST. However, they did end up implementing a variant of our Inclusive Blockchain Protocols, also published in Financial Crypto that year (coauthored with Yoad Lewenberg). This paper first proposed the directed acyclic graph structure for blocks, the \u201cblockDAG,\u201d but its focus was on increasing throughput (for the same security) and linearizing the block rewards across miners.\n\nAround the same time we developed a more thorough approach towards PoW consensus, and as part of it we realized a weakness in GHOST that does not allow it to scale regardless of network parameters-meaning, GHOST\u2019s block times and throughput, like Bitcoin\u2019s, are still limited by the network\u2019s latency. We then directed our efforts towards devising a PoW protocol, or family of protocols, that would alleviate the speed-security tradeoff, and would allow for arbitrarily short block times (provided the network\u2019s capacity limit is not exceeded). These protocols eventually became my PhD thesis, as well as my personal obsession (there are others, but I find this particular one less useless).\n\nLongest chain is largest 0-cluster\n\nThe proposition underlying my PhD research was that PoW can be made into an internet-speed service, if done correctly. Other than achieving speedy confirmation times, high block times reduce the variance of block rewards, mitigate the need to join mining pools, and thereby contribute to the decentralization of mining.\n\nThis vision is reinforced by the observation that Nakamoto Consensus is a special case of a larger family of protocols, PHANTOM (in fact, Nakamoto Consensus is the slowest member in this family), which can support a high block rate-subsecond block times, say. These protocols are based on blockDAGs. The core idea behind using a PoW-based DAG is to replace the mining paradigm of Nakamoto Consensus, in which miners propagate and extend the winning chain only, with the more informative paradigm, in which miners propagate and extend the entire history of blocks-each new block points at all recent blocks in the history, rather than to the winning one. This history-the blockDAG ledger-may contain conflicts, so the protocol needs to provide a preference ordering over all blocks in order to resolve inconsistencies. The properties of the resulting blockDAG system, and specifically its resilience to 49% attackers and its speed of convergence, are determined by this ordering protocol.\n\nThe latest protocol that we devised is called GHOSTDAG, and it is a member of a family of protocols called PHANTOM. In PHANTOM, we select (i.e., give preference in the ordering protocol) the largest k-cluster in the DAG, where a k-cluster is a sufficiently connected set-\u201dsufficiently\u201d as defined by the k parameter. This pre-encoded parameter represents an upper bound over the expected width of the DAG, informally the expected degree of asynchrony. When you choose k=0, PHANTOM coincides with the longest chain rule, and so it is a family of protocols in which Nakamoto Consensus is a special case. GHOSTDAG is a practical efficient variant of PHANTOM which chooses a large enough k-cluster.\n\nBlock liveness matters\n\nSome people argue that \u201cfaster block times\u201d is meaningless, and that confirmation times do not depend on block times. I agree that in a highly liquid, GPU-based mining platform a transaction\u2019s time to (probabilistic) settlement does not shorten due to short block times. Having conceded this, in a different post (WIP) I will elaborate on the importance of high block rate for faster confirmations, especially in an ASIC-powered system.\n\nThe path to preminelessness\n\nA few years into my PhD, there was interest from the community to build these protocols into a working platform. Guy Corem, and later Sizhao Yang, helped me raise a few million dollars from crypto VCs-a small amount in crypto 2018 terms-and we bootstrapped a small team of developers and researchers called DAGlabs. The money was given with the understanding that there will be no presale of tokens; premine or founders\u2019 rewards models are quite antithetical to a decentralized cryptocurrency project, as they usually (read: always) imply the control of a central organization, be it a for-profit company or a \u201cnon-profit\u201d foundation. Instead, DAGlabs used part of the money to purchase mining equipment, and it will participate in the mining of the new token with a plainspoken advantage of being the first to its market. More on this, and on mechanisms for community members to participate in mining, in a separate post. The major part of the funding went into R&D. DAGlabs developed code that is based on a fork of the BTCD full node codebase. A primary objective was keeping the design of the system as close to Bitcoin\u2019s architecture and assumptions as possible: PoW, blocks, UTXO, transactions fees, etc. The codebase underwent significant refactoring by the core devs, who then adapted it to a blockDAG governed by the GHOSTDAG protocol.\n\nKaspa it is\n\nThe vision behind this project is to build a Nakamoto-like service that operates on internet speed. We wanted to build a system that surpasses the limits of Satoshi\u2019s v1 protocol (aka Nakamoto Consensus) yet adheres to the same principles embedded in Bitcoin. Contrary to Satoshi\u2019s vision, Bitcoin did not become a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Instead, it is solidifying as the ultimate store of value, or e-gold, and that\u2019s pretty much it from the Bitcoin side.\u00b2 This is not a mild achievement by any measure-it\u2019s one of the most important financial revolutions in human history. Yet it leaves lots of room for improvement (of L1) and/or for choosing different tradeoffs (for L1).\n\nFor a thorough inspection of Satoshi\u2019s vision, I highly recommend Examining a Conspiracy Theory about Satoshi\u2019s Intent by Elliot Old.\n\nWe look to silver, which presented a different tradeoff vs. gold. As demonstrated in the prefacing quote about gold vs. silver (in the original Aramaic text: Dahava vs. Kaspa), silver was historically treated as less precious than gold but more circulative, less valuable yet more acceptable as payment. With this prospect I suggested the name \u201cKaspa\u201d for the project; \u201ckaspa\u201d is the Aramaic word for \u201csilver\u201d and \u201cmoney.\u201d\n\nThere are no solutions, only tradeoffs\n\nAside from optimizing for speed and accelerating the block rate, there are several axes on which I suggest Kaspa trades off differently than Bitcoin:\n\nOn a zero-sum game vs Litecoin\n\nAdmittedly, as Nick Szabo likes to remind us, any new cryptocurrency gets a negative on the social scalability part. This can be said on any new social network, not only money-powered ones. The sentiment against proliferation of coins is shared among almost everyone-we are all maximalists with respect to most cryptocurrencies created by other teams; non-coiners just go one coin further.\u00b3\n\nIn a sense, Kaspa does not aim to become another member of PoW coins but to replace an existing one \u2014 Litecoin. Litecoin was supposed to be the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, so we were told. However, it turned out to be quite totally useless, and provided no meaningful functionality over Bitcoin-it is essentially a basket of minor parameter changes from Bitcoin. From the perspective of a 2020 end-user, there\u2019s no major difference between waiting for 15 minutes and waiting for an hour; both are equivalent forms of \u201cforever.\u201d I admit to not fully understanding the \u201clite\u201d aspect in Litecoin. Depsite the meme, nothing in Litecoin\u2019s design makes it lighter; it bears the same block size limit as Bitcoin, and a theoretical higher throughput capacity. The only reason it is currently \u201clite\u201d is that it is empty\u2026 But a silver should be used more-not less-frequently than gold to justify itself, and a crypto silver\u2019s ledger should in fact be heavier than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps it is widely understood that Litecoin is simply a light-minded version of Bitcoin and its community, being more agile, and less principled than Satoshi\u2019s adamant followers. The founder going by @satoshilite does speak more to it than any further discussion. I suppose this light-mindedness was a positive thing at the time, as a testbed for Segwit was very much needed. (Just saying: if serving as a testbed for one patch to Bitcoin\u2019s protocol provided Litecoin with an intrinsic value of 10 10USD, imagine the potential market cap of Kaspa facilitating as a testbed for ten Bitcoin protocol patches!)\n\nMy hope is for Kaspa to become a home for the principled community of devs, researchers, and PoW fans, to be a vibrant testbed for new ideas, a place where innovation is welcome (outside the money base!) and the path to integration of tested and justified features is in sight. This agility is one of the privileges of being the self proclaimed \u201clittle brother,\u201d and we should take full advantage of it.\n\nThe burden of PoW is on us.\n\nTitle reference\n\n[1] I did solve the conjecture though, which was really fun and satisfying. It started by first breaking RSA using a hypothetical machine that transmitted waves whose crest points were supposed to coincide with the solutions to the relevant parabolic diophantine equation. It turns out that, for this to work in practice, the size of the machine had to exceed the size of the observable universe, as explained to me by our math professor. He claimed that my solution is equivalent to using an infinite registry, hence trivial. Although he was empathetic and all, I decided to leave the production-ready version for another time.\n\n[2] Notably, there are efforts to make Bitcoin usable for payments at large scale: the Lightning project. It is an interesting albeit unproven path for scaling, one which is more complex conceptually and UX-wise, which requires more trust (watch towers, etc.), and whose economics and decentralization dynamics are yet unknown.\n\n[3] By the way, Richard Dawkins\u2019 original statement assumes a very specific ordering of arguments. But if you first poll for the question whether Nature was created or rather created itself into being, most of us would probably take the former stance, despite disagreements about the pseudoidentity of its Creator. If you then run the GHOST protocol on the nodes of statements you will arrive at a different conclusion that the one Dawkins hoped for. So ordering matters.\n\nOriginally published at https://blocklivenessmatters.com on November 24, 2020.",

What exactly made it into this vibrant and innovative ecosystem? And can it last? I\u2019m writing this post in an attempt to clarify to self and pinpoint Ethereum\u2019s unique value offering and the emergent decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s success is commonly ascribed to its composability, the ability to compose one smart contract on top of another like lego boxes, leaving little-to-no need for development coordination, as once a dev team deployed a smart contract, any other smart contract can access it, permissionlessly. However, while Ethereum does harvest the power of openness and permissionlessness to reuse, extend, and compose different code bases and code components \u2014 this is by no means new or unique, it characterizes general open source values and structure. Almost by definition, open source allows one to build software composed of several code bases and libraries developed by others. So shared functionality, or composability of functionalities, isn\u2019t precising the matter.\n\nComposability \u2014 everyone\u2019s talking about it\n\nThe composability everyone\u2019s referring to is, I suppose, the ability to compose different functionalities while acting on and inside the same state. Ethereum combines open source shared functionality with Nakamoto Consensus to enable shared alterable state.\n\nWithout this shared state, the DeFi movement is reduced to a rising demand for using financial products that offer permissionless access to open APIs which communicate over a shared network (otherwise known as: the internet). If it was just transparent finance and open APIs, users wouldn\u2019t be able to issue transactions that access several dapps or financial products simultaneously in a manner whose consequences are predictable and pre-understood. Rather, they would need to transact separately with each dapp, and while these interactions could be automated, the cascade of events across these composable contracts wouldn\u2019t be predictable.\n\nAnd Ethereum is a game changer for DeFi precisely because it enables predictable cascading transactions, transactions of the form \u201cAlice locks Token Ali and Token Baba in the autonomous contract Compos, Compos increases its pool of Token Ali and Baba, their respective exchange rates adjust, and Alice is added to the list of shareholders benefiting from fees collected by Compos\u201d \u2014 all these assertions necessarily happening together (or together not happening). This property is known as atomicity, namely, the guarantee that a set of events and consequences will happen or not happen together. Let your imagination be carried with these endless composability options and you\u2019re on the right track to becoming a DeFi dev.\n\nOf course, transparent and permissionless finance is still an improvement over traditional finance, but these do not capture Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and the flywheel responsible for growing its network effect.\n\nCAP\n\nIn this section I want to illustrate and emphasize that composability + shared state = synchronous composability. Indeed, acting on a shared consensus state effectively requires that each transaction at its turn locks the state, fully executes, and completes its full update of the state, as in the Alice and Compos example above. I disagree with Georgios:\n\nTo press this point further, and to start unfolding Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, imagine an Ethereum variant where synchronous composability is violated; as we will see, unfortunately this thought experiment is not hypothetical, and there are good chances Ethereum is going down this road. We\u2019ll come back to this shortly. Concretely, imagine that smart contracts wouldn\u2019t communicate synchronously. That is, smart contracts would still be composable in the sense that they automatically interact with each other and trigger mutual function calls, but these function calls do not happen at the same transaction or block, rather, in this for-now-hypothetical Ethereum, it\u2019d a few hours or days for one contract to consider and update upon messages sent by other contracts.\n\nIt is highly questionable that such a system would be an impactful dapp platform as Ethereum has become. Among other difficulties, one obvious one is the great degree of unpredictability and indeterminism in the hours/days delayed execution of the transaction \u2014 the violation of synchronous composability is a violation of atomicity and in turn of predictability: The consequence of the cascade of events triggered by a transaction would be prohibitively unpredictable.\n\nWhile Ethereum users already suffer from some degree of uncertainty regarding the outcome of their transactions \u2014 a caveat inherent to acting inside a shared asynchronous environment \u2014 delaying parts of the execution for hours, let alone days, would make it rarely useful to issue rich composite transactions.\n\nFollowing these observations, and returning to Ethereum\u2019s original shared state principle, we may conclude that Ethereum\u2019s main value proposition is not mere composability, rather, synchronous composability, i.e., the ability to compose different functionalities while acting on and inside the same state.\n\nSo far so good, we can summarize Ethereum as satisfying CAP: Composability, Atomicity, Predictability. (The CAP theorem is anyways lame and should be abused in good conscience.)\n\nThe bad news\n\nBut shared state is inherently unscalable, as every individual transaction imposes externality costs on the entire network. This is the why and what of sharding \u2014 splitting the state across different zones so that a transaction imposes a computational burden on the validators of its shard only.\n\nAlmost any proposed roadmap for scaling Ethereum contains, in one way or another, sharding. While sharding is connotated with the Eth 2.0 vision, the updated rollups-vision for scaling Ethereum will silo the state across different rollups. (I use siloing to describe spontaneous grouping of smart contracts and validators, to distinguish it from random uniform allocation of validators, as in classical sharding.)\n\nThe by-design independence of a rollup (or shard) implies that its state can depend on events of another rollup only after the latter\u2019s state reached finality. From rollup Y\u2019s perspective, we replace the question \u201cIs the state of rollup X correct?\u201d with \u201cIs the state of rollup X finalized\u201d, which is sufficient for rollup Y and the system as a whole to operate and cooperate (users of rollup Y do not care, at least in the micro level, if the state of rollup X was corrupted).\n\nThis means that transactions that touch a few smart contracts, across different rollups, will need to wait for a long time before they are fully executed \u2014 if Alice\u2019s tokens are managed in rollup X, and Compos is managed in rollup Y, the execution of Alice\u2019s transaction will begin in rollup X, then wait for its finality, and only then complete inside rollup Y.\n\nWe reached the crux of rollup-centric Ethereum\u2019s composability problem:\n\nThe finality delay of the underlying sharding system dictates the degree of asynchrony, and with it the degree of unpredictability of transaction execution.\n\nIf we had finality periods of 2 seconds, as in Cosmos\u2019 utilization of tendermint (which is not for free, stronger assumptions are made), you can argue that maybe async composability is useful. But with optimistic-rollups, the finality is said to be hours or days long, maybe even weeks. This renders async composability useless for an optimistic-rollups-centric Ethereum.\u00b9\n\nFolks have proposed to circumvent the finality delay using cross-rollup liquidity providers (LPs). The solution is designed for fungible assets only, and it operates as follows:\n\nThe transactions in steps 3 and 4 are executed immediately on rollups X and Y, respectively, but are actionable outside each rollup only after the finality delay. (BTW, similarly to trustless staking pools, trustless liquidity pools don\u2019t make sense. Happy to help.)\n\nEthereum future.0\n\nAfter this deliberation, and reflecting on the possible outcomes, I see few possibilities for the Ethereum system henceforth:\n\nMonopolistic Scenario: One rollup takes it all, sync composability wins, sharding loses. In this path, there is a scalability gain from decoupling computation from data availability (the former handled by the rollup, the latter by base consensus), which is somewhat beneficial, but users\u2019 transactions still impose full externalities on the entire network, so state bloat is not addressed. Since different rollups introduce different assumptions (e.g., ZKRUs don\u2019t rely on censorship resistance for correctness), one winner takes it all could be more risky.\n\nI will elaborate on why this is still somewhat beneficial in another post.\n\nOptimistic Scenario: Multiple rollups thrive, sync composability is ruined, async composability is useless, Ethereum network is fragmented into rollup subnetworks, and liquidity providers facilitate the interoperability of the subnetworks with respect to fungible tokens.\n\nEthereum\u2019s base layer would remain the kernel of the ecosystem, its settlement layer, serving the dispute resolution (DR) and snark/stark verification functionalities, and potentially the data availability (DA) one as well. While Ethereum\u2019s base consensus is okay for DR, these scenarios would/should probably lead to using a different DA layer that is optimized for this functionality; Vitalik half-jokingly once suggested BCH as a candidate, and some side-chain projects offer their own DA layer. (This topic is outside the scope of this post, but do remind me to tell you about the ideal requirements from a DA layer, in light of the MEV crisis. Thanks.)\n\nAll hell breaks loose scenario: A supernova event. With the ecosystem being built on the foundations of a shared state kernel, and with this kernel losing its power due to the unscalability and surging gas prices, natural and genuine forces in the community will clash amid efforts to coordinate migration into specific rollups, and recenter around a shared state. Considering the size of the community, coordinating migration will fail, clashes will increase, and the system and its original vision will collapse onto itself, leading to what I dub a supernova of the Ethereum giant.\n\nThe network effect of Ethereum as a cohesive ecosystem will evaporate into the ether, and the remnants of this event would form few to many subnetworks interoperating through designated LPs, ignoring or skipping Ethereum\u2019s base layer, implementing their own data availability and dispute resolution layers. Sociodevologically, projects and devs would still identify themselves as hardcore Ethereans. However, the social consensus around this identity, and the legitimacy of proclaiming it, will naturally fracture.\n\n\u201cThe world will spin and the color will fade, and we\u2019ll be reduced to a spectrum of gray.\u201d\n\n*Title reference\n\n[1] In contrast to optimistic rollups, ZKRUs rely on (the stronger) validity proofs, and do not require therefore a finality delay. However, there is some delay until proofs are generated, and the tech seems infeasible as a short-to-mid term solution for general purpose smart contracts. Efforts here are pioneered by MatterLabs, Starkware, and Aztec.\n\nOriginally published at https://blocklivenessmatters.com on March 4, 2020.",
