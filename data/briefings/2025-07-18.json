Proposes adopting an alternate paradigm for verifiable proofs without external data.  \n  [View Issue #709](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/709)\n\n---\n\n## Activity Overview\n\n- **Development activity was minimal**, with one new feature proposal issue submitted and no commits or pull requests.\n- **Key contributor:** freshair18 (issue author).\n- **Notable trend:** Attention is being drawn to protocol-level limitations relating to transaction proof in the presence of block pruning, sparking discussion on cryptographic solutions for historical data verification.",
