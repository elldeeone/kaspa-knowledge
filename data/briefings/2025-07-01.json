          "summary": "**Kaspa Where To (Part IV, Last) – Technical Briefing Summary**\n\n**Key Points & Technical Concepts:**\n- **Mining Evolution:** Kaspa is transitioning from GPU-dominated (OpEx) to ASIC-driven (CapEx-heavy) mining. This shift is viewed as positive for network security and long-term stability, mirroring earlier transitions from CPU to GPU mining.\n- **Decentralization Perspective:** True decentralization is defined by open, permissionless participation rather than simply the number of mining entities. ASIC dominance isn’t inherently centralizing unless it introduces “rich-get-richer” feedback loops.\n- **Security Model:** Instantaneous confirmation in Kaspa relies on an illiquid mining market (unrentable hashrate). CapEx dominance (via ASICs) decreases the feasibility of attacks using transient hashpower (e.g., NiceHash).\n- **Energy Efficiency:** CapEx-heavy (ASIC) mining improves overall energy efficiency and reduces security budget “burn” per block, contributing to Kaspa’s suitability for future deflationary phases and mass adoption.\n\n**Important Developments & Announcements:**\n- **ASICs Forthcoming:** The anticipated arrival of ASIC miners will mark Kaspa’s shift into its maturity phase, improving security, efficiency, and ecosystem resilience.\n- **Security Health:** Currently, only 5.3% of Kaspa's hashpower is rentable (e.g., via NiceHash), indicating a continued safe, illiquid mining environment at this stage.\n\n**Relevance to Kaspa’s Ecosystem:**\n- The transition to ASIC mining is a necessary and intentional step for Kaspa’s long-term vision: scaling permissionless, practically instant confirmation times and ensuring security as network value grows.\n- Greater CapEx commitment from miners is critical for resisting market-based attacks and boosting both efficiency and sustainability, enhancing Kaspa’s case for broader adoption.\n\n*Actionable Insight:* Stakeholders should prepare for and embrace the ASIC mining era, supporting infrastructure and policies that maintain openness and resist centralizing forces as the ecosystem matures."

Key Points and Technical Concepts**\n- **DAGKNIGHT (DK) Protocol:** Co-developed by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Sutton, DK is a next-generation DAG consensus protocol intended for Kaspa. Main development tasks are outlined in [KIP #2](https://github.com/kaspanet/kips/blob/master/kip-0002.md).\n- **Development Funding Models:** Three models discussed:\n  - *Gift Culture/Open-source:* Voluntary, no direct incentives.\n  - *Grant-Based:* Community-funded grants denominated in KAS (Kaspa token), aligned with ecosystem opportunity rather than USD salary stability.\n  - *For-Profit Enterprise Layer:* Involves companies investing in core infra, more feasible for app/smart contract layers than base infra like DK.\n\n**2. Important Developments or Announcements**\n- **New Grant Proposal:** Authors are requesting a 70 million KAS grant (~0.5% of circulating supply) to support DK implementation, benchmarked against a previous 100 MKAS grant.\n- **Implementation Commitment:** Regardless of grant outcome, authors will attempt DK implementation (albeit with no strict timeline if unfunded).\n\n**3. Relevance to Kaspa’s Ecosystem**\n- **Sustainability and Long-Term Development:** Explores sustainable models for continuous infra development in Kaspa.\n- **Community Governance:** Highlights community involvement in funding key protocol upgrades.\n- **Strategic Priorities:** Positions DK protocol upgrade as foundational for Kaspa but acknowledges challenges in aligning incentives and securing developer resources without sustained funding mechanisms. \n\n**Actionable Insight:**  \nKaspa stakeholders should review and engage with the new DK development grant proposal, as its approval may accelerate critical infra upgrades and impact network capability. The discussion also frames ongoing challenges in open-source blockchain sustainability models."
