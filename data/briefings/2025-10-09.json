      "summary": "**Summary of Forum Activity**\n\n**Topic:** Random Linear Network Coding For Scalable BlockDAG\n\n**Main Discussion Points:**\n- **Key Technical Topic:**  \n  - The post centers on applying Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to BlockDAG-based blockchains, specifically targeting more efficient transaction propagation.\n  - Focus is given to redundancy in parent hash propagation within Kaspa, especially as Crescendo increases concurrency and thus the number of indirect parents (often hundreds per block).\n  - The author, Gordon_Murray, limits the scope to transaction data propagation for now, with the possibility of expanding RLNC techniques to headers in the future.\n\n- **RLNC for Transactions (Plain English Explanation):**\n  - RLNC is described as a mechanism to encode transaction data into combinations, enabling scalable, robust, and efficient block data dissemination.\n  - The discussion emphasizes that this is primarily about transaction data, not header or parent propagation (yet).\n\n**Important Community Insights:**\n- Despite only one author posting, the explanation acknowledges community concerns about redundancy from parent hash inclusion and aims to address transaction-level inefficiencies first.\n- There's recognition that RLNC's benefits for scalability and redundancy reduction could also apply to headers and parent structures as a future step.\n\n**Solutions and Sentiment:**\n- Solution presented: Use RLNC for transaction propagation, addressing a major bottleneck in BlockDAG scaling.\n- Sentiment appears constructive and exploratory, with a focus on technical clarity and possible roadmap expansion.\n\n**Notable Developments or Trends:**\n- Interest in cutting-edge coding theory (RLNC) to tackle real-world scalability issues in high-concurrency BlockDAGs such as Kaspa.\n- Likely trend towards modular improvement (starting with transaction data, with a view toward headers/parents next).\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe current discussion is an initial technical exploration by Gordon_Murray into leveraging RLNC for more efficient, scalable transaction propagation in BlockDAG networks like Kaspa. It responds to community concerns about redundancy caused by numerous indirect parents and outlines a potential path toward broader RLNC adoption in the protocol. The approach is problem-focused and opens the door to further discussion and technical proposals as implementation considerations are addressed.",
