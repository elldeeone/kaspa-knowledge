### Technical

**There is a panic in rusty-kaspa when trying to access a non-existent key in the Ghostdag store, leading to node crashes via an unhandled `Result::unwrap()` call on an `Err` value of `KeyNotFound`.**

*Context:* This bug report documents a reproducible crash scenario affecting node stability in the Rust implementation, which could impair network reliability or operator experience. The store's handling of missing keys is insufficiently robust, signaling the need for improved error handling in consensus/database code paths.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical
