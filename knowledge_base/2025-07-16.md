### Technical

**A comprehensive smart contract infrastructure has been implemented for Kaspa, integrating with the existing txscript and consensus architecture.**

*Context:* signal.is_lead is true; this is a core protocol milestone originating from the primary technical implementer.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

**New infrastructure for smart contract-related opcodes (currently placeholders OpUnknown240-245) has been introduced to the scripting system.**

*Context:* Sets groundwork for future opcode expansion specific to smart contract operations.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

**A ContractStateStore trait and corresponding database implementation (DbContractStateStore) have been added for managing contract state alongside the UTXO set.**

*Context:* Enables stateful smart contract interactions while preserving compatibility with the network’s existing UTXO model.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

**A new contract validation pipeline is included, incorporating a ContractValidator trait, a basic validator implementation, and integration with the transaction validation process.**

*Context:* Ensures smart contracts undergo protocol-level validation before acceptance, upholding consensus security.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

**WASM-based runtime infrastructure has been integrated, allowing execution of contracts compiled to WASM, with supporting JavaScript/TypeScript bindings for external interaction.**

*Context:* Cross-language contract execution is now feasible, expanding developer tooling and deployment options.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

> **CONTEXT:** This section contains key facts and technical information  
> **Topic:** Consensus  
> **Facts Count:** 1  
> **Source:** `data/facts/2025-07-16.json`

### Consensus

**The TxScriptEngine now includes a kip15_enabled flag, which facilitates activation of smart contract functionality through a hardfork mechanism.**

*Context:* Introduces explicit activation gating via KIP-15, aligning with protocol governance for upgrade scheduling.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Consensus

> **CONTEXT:** This section contains key facts and technical information  
> **Topic:** Development  
> **Facts Count:** 1  
> **Source:** `data/facts/2025-07-16.json`

### Development

**The implementation includes comprehensive documentation (docs/smart-contracts-design.md) and example smart contracts in both Rust and WASM formats.**

*Context:* Provides developers with guidance and reference materials to build on the new system.

*Impact:* Medium | *Category:* Development

*Source:* feat: Add smart contract infrastructure proof-of-concept by bmw-m340i ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/708))

> **CONTEXT:** This section contains key facts and technical information  
> **Topic:** Testing  
> **Facts Count:** 1  
> **Source:** `data/facts/2025-07-16.json`

### Testing

**An integration test framework for smart contracts was introduced, with all 70/70 existing txscript tests passing, demonstrating backward compatibility.**

*Context:* Maintains protocol stability while introducing major new functionality; ensures new features do not disrupt existing operations.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Testing
