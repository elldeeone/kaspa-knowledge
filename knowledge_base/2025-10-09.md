**Summary of Forum Activity**

**Topic:** Random Linear Network Coding For Scalable BlockDAG

**Main Discussion Points:**
- **Key Technical Topic:**  
  - The post centers on applying Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to BlockDAG-based blockchains, specifically targeting more efficient transaction propagation.
  - Focus is given to redundancy in parent hash propagation within Kaspa, especially as Crescendo increases concurrency and thus the number of indirect parents (often hundreds per block).
  - The author, Gordon_Murray, limits the scope to transaction data propagation for now, with the possibility of expanding RLNC techniques to headers in the future.

- **RLNC for Transactions (Plain English Explanation):**
  - RLNC is described as a mechanism to encode transaction data into combinations, enabling scalable, robust, and efficient block data dissemination.
  - The discussion emphasizes that this is primarily about transaction data, not header or parent propagation (yet).

**Important Community Insights:**
- Despite only one author posting, the explanation acknowledges community concerns about redundancy from parent hash inclusion and aims to address transaction-level inefficiencies first.
- There's recognition that RLNC's benefits for scalability and redundancy reduction could also apply to headers and parent structures as a future step.

**Solutions and Sentiment:**
- Solution presented: Use RLNC for transaction propagation, addressing a major bottleneck in BlockDAG scaling.
- Sentiment appears constructive and exploratory, with a focus on technical clarity and possible roadmap expansion.

**Notable Developments or Trends:**
- Interest in cutting-edge coding theory (RLNC) to tackle real-world scalability issues in high-concurrency BlockDAGs such as Kaspa.
- Likely trend towards modular improvement (starting with transaction data, with a view toward headers/parents next).

**Summary:**  
The current discussion is an initial technical exploration by Gordon_Murray into leveraging RLNC for more efficient, scalable transaction propagation in BlockDAG networks like Kaspa. It responds to community concerns about redundancy caused by numerous indirect parents and outlines a potential path toward broader RLNC adoption in the protocol. The approach is problem-focused and opens the door to further discussion and technical proposals as implementation considerations are addressed.

### Performance

**Kaspa currently propagates parent hashes in blocks, including indirect parents, which can result in several hundred parents per block under high concurrency scenarios like Crescendo, leading to significant redundancy.**

*Context:* This matters because high redundancy in parent hash propagation can decrease network efficiency, especially as block concurrency increases in protocols like Kaspa under Crescendo.

**Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) can be applied to block data (specifically transaction propagation) in Kaspa to reduce duplication and coordination overhead; nodes can recover all transactions from any set of innovative coded packets, minimizing the need for direct requests and repeated downloads.**

*Context:* This approach addresses inefficiencies in the current transaction propagation method, particularly reducing bandwidth waste and latency associated with duplicates and repeated request cycles in highly parallel blockDAG environments.

**RLNC allows nodes to treat duplicate transaction data across many parallel blocks as a single download, consolidating repeated transactions into a single source for decoding across blocks.**

*Context:* By eliminating duplicated downloads for the same transactions appearing in several blocks, this significantly improves network utilization and performance in a blockDAG like Kaspa's.

**RLNC adds a planned overcode of typically five to ten percent, which helps avoid delays from fetching "tail" transactions that would otherwise dominate completion time in traditional models.**

*Context:* This optimization ensures the node can finish block assembly more reliably and quickly, even as the number of pending transactions dwindles in the endgame phase.
