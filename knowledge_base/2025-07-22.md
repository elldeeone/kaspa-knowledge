## Key Facts

> **CONTEXT:** This section contains key facts and technical information  
> **Topic:** Governance  
> **Facts Count:** 1  
> **Source:** `data/facts/2025-07-22.json`

### Governance

**DNS seeders managed by H@H have been removed from the Kaspa codebase, following a specific request from H@H.**

*Context:* This change alters the set of DNS seeders used for network bootstrapping, which can affect network connectivity and peer discovery, but does not directly change protocol rules.

*Impact:* Medium | *Category:* Governance

*Source:* Wasm utxo return address (#704)

* fix wasm builds

* generate wasm binding to support GetUtxoReturnAddress RPC request by Maxim ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/commit/9902ba491cafd8a8ca54741c5a4ec52a97946119))

> **Topic:** Development  
> **Facts Count:** 2  
> **Source:** `data/facts/2025-07-22.json`

### Development

**WebAssembly (WASM) builds of Kaspa now generate a binding to support the GetUtxoReturnAddress RPC request.**

*Context:* Enabling this RPC in the WASM interface expands programmatic access to UTXO-related operations in browser and cross-platform environments, potentially broadening developer use-cases.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Development

*Source:* fix wasm builds (#691) by Maxim ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/commit/b3edc695ee329e532043ec896270ccd2c1caee1f))

**WASM builds for the Kaspa project have been fixed to resolve prior build issues.**

*Context:* Functional WASM builds are essential for maintaining browser compatibility and supporting cross-platform development; issues in this area can inhibit key developer and user experiences.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Development
