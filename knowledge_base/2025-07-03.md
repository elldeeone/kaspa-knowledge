**A new IBD (Initial Block Download) type called pruning_catchup has been introduced. It is triggered when: (1) the syncer's and node's pruning points do not match; (2) the node knows the header of the syncer's pruning point and can verify it is a future descendant of its own pruning point; (3) the node does not have the block body of the syncer's pruning point.**

*Context:* This change refines syncing behavior under pruning, enabling nodes to synchronize safely when pruning points differ, rather than always restarting IBD from scratch or risking invalid state transitions.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* IBD Handle Syncer Pruning Movement by freshair18 ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/702))

**Before performing any irreversible operations during pruning_catchup, the node downloads and validates headers from the syncer up to the declared sink. Destructive changes (e.g., moving the pruning point) occur only after confirming: (1) the syncer's pruning point is a valid pruning sample; (2) the chain built on it has blue score greater than P.b_score+pruning_depth; (3) the syncer pruning point lies on the selected chain and header-declared pruning points on its path are consistent.**

*Context:* This staged validation process increases safety before making irreversible changes to the node's state in a pruned network scenario.

**The process of updating to a new pruning point consists of three sub-stages: (1) updating multiple stores (pruning_point, virtual, past_pruning_points, pruning samples, selected chain, and body_tips) in batch; (2) downloading and verifying the new pruning UTXO set from a peer; (3) downloading block bodies of the new pruning point and its anticone, with special attention as some parents will always lack bodies and only trusted validation is done.**

*Context:* Breaking down the pruning catchup into these phased steps allows more robust handling of state transitions, particularly managing intermediate states safely and efficiently.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* IBD Handle Syncer Pruning Movement by freshair18 ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/702))

**The current implementation introduces transitional states with explicit flags representing situations where (a) pruning point movement has occurred but (b) the pruning UTXO set is not yet downloaded or (c) the anticone's block bodies have not all been verified. The required anticone is computed and stored at the pruning point movement stage to facilitate safe progression.**

*Context:* This explicit handling of partial progress reduces risk of inconsistency or abuse during pruning-related syncs, increasing robustness in node operation following updates in a pruned network.

*Impact:* High | *Category:* Technical

*Source:* IBD Handle Syncer Pruning Movement by freshair18 ([link](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/702))

**In contrast to previous IBD_with_headers_proof, pruning_catchup builds upon the existing consensus (rather than starting from a discardable staging consensus) and handles intermediary states instead of requiring atomic, all-or-nothing progress.**

*Context:* This reflects a substantial refinement in how Kaspa nodes update and synchronize in networks under pruning, aiming for greater flexibility and security.

**There is a proposal for KIP10’ized UTXOs to have an optional user-defined limit on the number of times they can be reused, potentially implemented using a counter in the Script Public Key (SPK), which decrements upon each use and prevents further use when reaching zero.**

*Context:* This mechanism would restrict how many times an additive address (KIP10) UTXO can be collected, introducing more granular control and security over UTXO reuse.

### Consensus | Security

**There are two paradigms for transaction confirmation in cryptocurrencies: one where security is achieved by waiting for a certain number of blocks to be mined atop a transaction (accelerated by faster block times), and one where users simply wait for a given amount of absolute time to elapse.**

*Context:* This clarification from Yonatan Sompolinsky highlights a core design question addressed by Kaspa: optimizing confirmation logic for scenarios where fast blocks actually improve user experience and security.

**From the merge-set perspective, the main difference in treating red blocks is that their block rewards are given to the merging block, which imposes a cost on double-spending attempts.**

*Context:* This technical design detail penalizes double-spending or otherwise non-canonical blocks by redirecting their rewards, similar to how orphan blocks in Bitcoin do not receive rewards, thus strengthening Kaspa's security.

### Consensus, Performance, Scalability

**L2 throughput on Kaspa-based rollups must be capped, and L1 sequencers (miners) are responsible for enforcing per-block gas unit limits for each L2 instance as part of L1 consensus.**

*Context:* This establishes that L1 consensus, rather than individual L2 logic, is tasked with regulating L2 throughput. This mechanism is critical for preventing user experience issues where transactions appear on L1 but are ignored by L2, and for maintaining a fair and DoS-resilient environment.

### Mining | Consensus (Potentially)

**The post suggests a further technical idea where new blocks could invalidate prior consolidated coinbase transactions and validate a new consolidation only if payment is to the same address as an existing block.**

*Context:* This is an implementation suggestion for handling state changes to prevent invalid UTXO consolidation, though it is not a canonical protocol change.

*Impact:* Low | *Category:* Mining | Consensus (Potentially)

<p>Indeed both Plonk &amp; Groth16 require trusted-setup ceremony, but not for L2s. For each version of <code>zkVMs</code> in case of chain of 2 proof systems. If L2 decides to implement its logic directly in terms of Plonk/Groth16 then yes.</p>

<p>You’re right, that’s probably the better way to go. For the fallback mechanism we only really need <span class="math">SQC(B.sp)</span> rather than anything else, and hashing the global index alongside the tx will prevent the need to hash all txs twice.</p>
