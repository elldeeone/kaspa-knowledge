### Forum

### Summary: Discourse Forum – "Data Availability Concerns"

**Key Technical Discussion:**  
- **State Replication:** The post by Hans_Moog (hashdag) centers on how state replication is handled in the context of a "common good" setup versus default configurations.  
- **Opt-In/Opt-Out Models:** Hans discusses whether users should need to opt in to replicate state (the "common good" approach), compared to the current default where they must opt out.  
- **Node Requirements:** The discussion contrasts with other networks where nodes are required to replicate the full smart contract state to validate blocks efficiently, whereas historical data replication can be optional.

**Community Insights & Sentiment:**  
- Hans_Moog highlights the importance of default behaviors—arguing that making data retention the default improves reliability.
- He suggests that, from a technical perspective, requiring nodes to retain state data is "not unreasonable" and is beneficial for the network's functioning.

**Trends & Developments:**  
- There is a clear focus on improving data availability and the trade-offs between voluntary and mandatory data retention.
- The topic hints at evolving best practices in node responsibility and the balance of efficiency versus decentralization in blockchain networks.

**Forum Activity Note:**  
- Only one author has participated so far, so the discussion currently represents a single strong technical viewpoint rather than broad community consensus. However, the points raised are relevant foundational issues likely to attract further debate.

### Technical

**Kaspa’s protocol is modular enough to potentially enable a system where not all nodes are required to globally store and execute the entire state; actors can be configured to only store and execute subsets of the global state relevant to them.**

*Context:* This contribution outlines that Kaspa's architecture allows for selective state storage and execution, which could impact scalability, data availability, and the way clients are implemented.

*Impact:* Medium | *Category:* Technical

**In other blockchain networks, it is standard for nodes to be required to replicate the entire smart contract state to efficiently validate blocks, and data retention is the default, but pruning state growth is a significant scalability bottleneck.**

*Context:* This context compares Kaspa’s potential approach with industry standards, noting the tradeoff between data retention defaults and scalability—relevant as Kaspa investigates more modular and potentially more scalable alternatives.

**Pruning (removing unneeded state data) changes the nature of the state-availability challenge in Kaspa, affecting how state and data availability are handled but does not introduce a fundamentally new challenge compared to other networks.**

*Context:* Indicates that while pruning introduces new considerations for state availability, reliance on social consensus and concerns about data availability are not unique to Kaspa, but may play out differently due to Kapsa’s modularity.
