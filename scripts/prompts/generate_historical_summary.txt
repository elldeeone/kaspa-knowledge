Based on {total_items} items from {period_label} ({start_date} to {end_date}), create a comprehensive historical development summary:

**Period:** {period_label}
**Data Sources:** {sources_processed}
**Items Analyzed:** {total_items}
**Duration:** {duration_days} days

Please provide:

## Leadership and Strategic Insights
**Use comprehensive signal enrichment system for content prioritization:**
- **Top Insights** (signal.final_score > 0.85): Critical strategic decisions, breakthrough discoveries, major architectural changes
- **Recent Developments** (signal.final_score 0.70-0.85): Important strategic updates, significant progress milestones, notable implementations
- **Standard Contributions** (signal.final_score 0.40-0.70): Regular development activity, routine improvements, community contributions
- **Archive Material** (signal.final_score < 0.40): Historical context, background information, reference material
- **Founders** (signal.is_founder: true): Strategic vision, architectural decisions, long-term roadmap insights
- **Lead Developers** (signal.is_lead: true): Technical direction, implementation guidance, priority setting
- **Core Developers** (signal.contributor_role: "core_developer"): Technical implementations, code reviews, system improvements
- Strategic planning and roadmap discussions
- Development priority decisions and resource allocation
- Cross-team coordination and collaboration efforts
- Technical debt management and refactoring initiatives

## Period-Specific Analysis
- Adapt analysis depth based on period length:
  - Short periods (1-7 days): Focus on immediate developments and daily progress
  - Medium periods (1-4 weeks): Emphasize weekly patterns and tactical progress
  - Long periods (1+ months): Highlight strategic trends and macro-developments

Tailor the summary comprehensiveness to match the period scope while maintaining focus on the most impactful developments and their broader implications for the project.
