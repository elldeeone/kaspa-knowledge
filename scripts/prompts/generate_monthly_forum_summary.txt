Based on the Discourse forum activity data below for {period_label} ({start_date} to {end_date}), create a comprehensive monthly forum community analysis using the signal prioritization system:

**Period:** {period_label}
**Duration:** {duration_days} days
**Total Posts:** {total_items}
**Topics:** {topic_count} | **Authors:** {author_count} | **Active Discussions:** {active_discussions}

**SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION GUIDE:**
Use the `signal` metadata in each post to prioritize analysis:
- **Top Insights** (final_score > 0.85): Most important community discussions requiring immediate attention
- **Recent Developments** (final_score 0.70-0.85): Significant ongoing conversations and valuable contributions
- **Standard Contributions** (final_score 0.40-0.70): Regular community activity and discussions
- **Archive Material** (final_score < 0.40): Historical context and background discussions

**CONTRIBUTOR SIGNAL WEIGHTING:**
- **Founders** (is_founder: true): Strategic vision and community direction
- **Lead Developers** (is_lead: true): Technical guidance and expert opinions
- **Core Developers** (contributor_role: "core_developer"): Technical explanations and implementation insights
- **High Signal Strength** (strength: "high"): Prioritize these contributions regardless of role

**Forum Activity Data:**
