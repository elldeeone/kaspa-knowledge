Extract key technical facts from this monthly Kaspa development data for {period_label} ({start_date} to {end_date}):

**SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION GUIDE:**
Use the `signal` metadata to prioritize fact extraction:
- **Top Insights** (final_score > 0.85): Extract all facts - these are critical developments
- **Recent Developments** (final_score 0.70-0.85): Extract major facts - important ongoing work
- **Standard Contributions** (final_score 0.40-0.70): Extract notable facts - significant activity
- **Archive Material** (final_score < 0.40): Extract only if historically significant

**CONTRIBUTOR SIGNAL WEIGHTING:**
- **Founders** (is_founder: true): Prioritize all strategic and architectural facts
- **Lead Developers** (is_lead: true): Prioritize technical direction and design decisions
- **Core Developers** (contributor_role: "core_developer"): Focus on implementation and system improvements
- **High Signal Strength** (strength: "high"): Extract facts regardless of role

Please extract technical facts using signal-driven prioritization. For each fact, format as:

- **FACT:** [specific technical fact or development]
- **AUTHOR:** [contributor name and role, e.g., "@author (core_developer)"]
- **CATEGORY:** [protocol|consensus|security|performance|tooling|infrastructure|governance|mining|community|integration]
- **IMPACT:** [high|medium|low] 
- **SIGNAL_CONTEXT:** [final_score: X.XX, strength: X, role: X, significance explanation]
- **CONTEXT:** [why this matters for Kaspa's development, focusing on monthly themes and strategic direction]

Focus on:
- **Strategic developments** that shaped the month's direction
- **Technical breakthroughs** and architectural decisions
- **Cross-cutting initiatives** that spanned multiple areas
- **Foundation work** that enables future development
- **Risk factors** and technical debt addressed
- **Ecosystem impacts** affecting external integrations

Prioritize facts from higher signal scores and emphasize monthly patterns over daily details.
