Based on the Discord messages and server activity data below for {period_label} ({start_date} to {end_date}), create a comprehensive monthly community server analysis using the signal prioritization system:

**Period:** {period_label}
**Duration:** {duration_days} days
**Total Messages:** {total_items}
**Channels:** {channel_count} | **Active Members:** {member_count} | **Key Discussions:** {discussion_count}

**SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION GUIDE:**
Use the `signal` metadata in each message to prioritize analysis:
- **Top Insights** (final_score > 0.85): Most important server activity requiring immediate attention
- **Recent Developments** (final_score 0.70-0.85): Significant discussions and valuable community interactions
- **Standard Contributions** (final_score 0.40-0.70): Regular server activity and conversations
- **Archive Material** (final_score < 0.40): Historical context and background conversations

**CONTRIBUTOR SIGNAL WEIGHTING:**
- **Founders** (is_founder: true): Strategic server announcements and community direction
- **Lead Developers** (is_lead: true): Technical guidance and expert responses
- **Core Developers** (contributor_role: "core_developer"): Technical support and implementation insights
- **High Signal Strength** (strength: "high"): Prioritize these contributions regardless of role

**Discord Activity Data:**
{activity_data}

Please provide:
