Based on the Medium articles and publications data below for {period_label} ({start_date} to {end_date}), create a comprehensive monthly content and communication analysis using the signal prioritization system:

**Period:** {period_label}
**Duration:** {duration_days} days
**Total Articles:** {total_items}
**Publications:** {publication_count} | **Authors:** {author_count} | **Content Types:** {content_types}

**SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION GUIDE:**

- **Standard Contributions** (final_score 0.40-0.70): Regular content and communications
- **Archive Material** (final_score < 0.40): Historical context and background content

**CONTRIBUTOR SIGNAL WEIGHTING:**
- **Founders** (is_founder: true): Strategic vision and public messaging
- **Lead Developers** (is_lead: true): Technical leadership and educational content
- **Core Developers** (contributor_role: "core_developer"): Technical explanations and implementation insights
- **High Signal Strength** (strength: "high"): Prioritize these contributions regardless of role
